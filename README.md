[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8a4fd93b-084a-40bf-a380-9cc1cc51f3d9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wonderful-blackwell-56849e/deploys)

## Build and testing locally

Building currently depends on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/):

```bash
npm install

npm run start
```

A Netlify server can be run locally to test the redirects:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli

netlify dev
```
