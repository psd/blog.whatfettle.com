	<p><em>This is day 15 of <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/10/13/one-csv-thirty-stories/">One <span class="caps">CSV</span>, 30 stories</a> a series of articles exploring <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads">price paid data</a> from the Land Registry found on <span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK. The code for this and the other articles is available as open source from <a href="https://github.com/psd/price-paid-data">GitHub</a></em></p>

	<p>Following on from <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/11/07/one-csv-thirty-stories-14-hackday/">yesterday</a>&#8217;s hackday I had a spot of breakfast with <a href="https://twitter.com/mikiee_t">Michael</a>. I tweaked the map from <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/11/06/one-csv-thirty-stories-13-postcodes/">Day 13</a> to <a href="https://github.com/psd/price-paid-data/commit/38bedba7c6d07d8397380780a1a62d81c48c2236">scale the size of each postcode</a> using the total volume of transactions over 20 years:</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/15545225717" title="Volume Scattermap by Paul Downey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7491/15545225717_8c021454fb_c.jpg" width="652" height="800" alt="Volume Scattermap"></a></p>

	<p>Michael quickly turned this image into a second poster [<a href="https://github.com/LandRegistry/hackday/raw/master/price-paid-data-scattermap.pdf"><span class="caps">PDF</span></a>] before dashing to the station.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m cock-a-hoop how this image has turned out. The detail looks like bacteria on a petri-dish, but zoomed out it&#8217;s apparent not just where people live, but where people buy and sell houses the most, with the coast of East Anglia, Eastbourne and Cornwall darker than you&#8217;d expect. I can guess this may be due to turnover of retirement homes or holiday cottages but it&#8217;s plain to see there are many more interesting stories begging to be discovered from this simple map weighted with other open data from the likes of the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/"><span class="caps">ONS</span></a>.</p>

	<p>This afternoon I&#8217;m on a train travelling back from Plymouth which means several hours <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_blackout">without access to the interwebs</a> â€” an ideal opportunity to <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/11/11/one-csv-thirty-stories-16-mapination/">iterate this hack</a>.</p>
