<p>But it does it pretty well: it lets your users use their own ids to login to your site. And that's it. That way you don't need to manage their usernames and passwords. But any further questions you might have about your user, like "<a href="http://www.jkg.in/openid/">who the heck are they</a>", "how old are they", and "can they pay me" are left quietly unsaid. <a href="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/archives/2007/01/21/openid-and-saml-a-swirling-nexus/">For now</a>.</p>
