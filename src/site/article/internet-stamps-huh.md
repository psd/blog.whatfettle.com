I usually enjoy <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing">ongoing</a>, but having just read <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/16/Internet-Stamps">Internet Stamps</a>, I'm wondering if October the 16th is Canadian Fool's Day, or something? Charles Babbage apparently proposed the original fixed price postage model that lead to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_black">Penny Black</a>, but introducing national Post Offices to the Internet is a really bad idea and I ain't buying it.</p>
