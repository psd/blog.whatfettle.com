<p>I bought a <a href="http://shop.lomography.com/actionsampler/">LOMO Action Sampler</a> with some money my mum gave me for my birthday and used it for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/72057594083625867/">some family fun</a> last Sunday. Strange having to wait a week to see the results and then having to scan them in for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/">flickr</a>.</p>
