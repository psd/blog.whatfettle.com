As mentioned <a href='/archives/000072.html'>previously</a>, each year I conjure up a quiz sheet to sell at our kid's School Spring Fair.

The aim is to guess the title for each picture which all have the theme in their subject's name. Last year the theme was "The Sea" so the quiz was entitled "Captain Blank", the year before was "Kings and Queens", so we had "King Blank : Queen Blank":

This year was more tricky.  The theme was Medieval England, so I came up with the tenuous "Sir Blank, Dame Blank":

I've uploaded the sheets (and answers) as PDF files, so if you're interested, give them a go:

<a href='/Quiz/King-Blank-Queen-Blank.pdf'>King Blank : Queen Blank</a> (1MB)
<a href='/Quiz/Captain-Blank.pdf'>Captain Blank</a> (600K)
<a href='/Quiz/Sir-Blank-Dame-Blank.pdf'>Sir Blank, Dame Blank</a> (1.4MB)

This year's contest is still open.  I wrote the sheet in such a rush, I made a stupid mistake and printed the wrong date for the closing entry. So feel free to send a copy in (with or without 50p/Â€1/$1 :-) and I'll update the PDF with the answers and results after the draw. [8/6/2004 - Updated with answers!]
