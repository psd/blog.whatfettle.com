<p><a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> is one of those things I keep on coming across, first through toy hackers such as <span class="vcard"><a href="http://www.krazydad.com/p5/" class="fn url nickname" rel="contact colleague">krazydad</a></span>, <span class="vcard"><a href="http://twitter.com/ni" class="fn url nickname" rel="friend colleague met">ni</a></span> [<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/792469">video</a>] and <a href="http://curiositycollective.org/curiosity/?p=276">The Curiosity Collective</a> and more recently in Maker articles and O'Reilly books such as <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514556/">Vizualizing Data</a> and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510510/">Making Things Talk</a>. I'd even invested in the rather heavy <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Processing-Creative-Coding-Computational-Foundation/dp/159059617X">Processing, Creative Coding and Computational Art</a>, all totally inspiring, and yet I somehow hadn't got around to actually doing anything with it. You see it's the whole Java thing that puts me off; when it comes to playtime life's far too short to wrangle a CLASSPATH or compile an applet.</p><p>So, it was great to see the amazing <span class="vcard"><a href="http://ejohn.org/" rel="colleague" class="fn url">John Resig</a></span> finally release his native Javascript implementation <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/">Processing.js</a>. To allow easy experimention, I've wrapped John's code into a <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a> <a href="http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/contributors/PaulDowney/plugins/ProcessingjsPlugin.js">Plugin</a>, which took all of 10 minutes thanks to the prior art of <a href="http://simonbaird.com/">Simon Baird</a>'s <a href="http://mptw2.tiddlyspot.com/#Clock2">cool clock</a>. It took a little longer to knife and fork John's <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/processing.js/examples/basic/">basic examples</a> into a <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2008/05/TiddlyProcessing/">TiddlyProcessing</a> TiddlyWiki [<a href="http://svn.tiddlywiki.org/Trunk/contributors/PaulDowney/verticals/TiddlyProcessing/">subversion</a>], mainly because <a href="http://twitter.com/jeresig/statuses/808257007">his server was being hammered</a>.</p><p>The result is a single <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2008/05/TiddlyProcessing/">HTML page</a> you can double click on an example to view the Processing source, edit it, and see the results immediately without refreshing the page.  <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2008/05/TiddlyProcessing/download.php">Download</a> and reopen it in Firefox and you'll be able to save your changes locally. <i>Not all the examples work, in particular those which use external images. You can save your changes in other browsers if you follow the generic <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/#DownloadSoftware">TiddlyWiki instructions</a>. </i>.</p>
<p>All great fun, but it is just a hack, and I somehow doubt the purveyors of more complete bids for global vendor lock-in, such as Silverlight and AIR, are too worried as yet. But they should be. A combination of video as <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/08/video/">a first class citizen of the Web</a>, <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML:Canvas">Canvas</a> in <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#the-canvas">decent browsers</a> and <a href="http://javascript.neyric.com/wireit/">libraries</a> and <a href="http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/">emulations</a> using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a> elsewhere seems pretty close to being <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/03/30/houston-we-have-an-opportunity/">good enough</a>. As much as I'd love to see <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/Talks/11-15-steven-soc/">more declarative approaches</a> take off, I can't help but think <a href="http://twitter.com/psd/statuses/807343521">we've entered the age of the canvas!</a></p>
<i>Update:  <span class="vcard"><a href="http://simonbaird.com/" rel="colleague met contact" class="fn url">Simon Baird</a></span> has tweaked the plugin to avoid the need to escape single quotes and put <a href="http://tiddlyprocessing-simon.tiddlyspot.com/">his version</a> up on <a href="http://tiddlyspot.com/">TiddlySpot</a>, a great place to store your TiddlyWikis.</i>
