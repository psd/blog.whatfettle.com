Arrived in NYC in the USA for a F2F of the W3C WSD WG, OK? Unfortunately despite booking well in advance the Sheraton only had a smoker's room left. I kicked up enough of a fuss to effectively get tonight for free (lucky old BT), but that doesn't stop the room from stinking or my throat from hurting :-((  

Quite an interesting view down onto Broadway with crowds leaving "Bombay Nights" and "The Late Show", though I'm not really a Letterman fan, less so after watching <a href='http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0305206/combined'>American Splendour</a> on the flight over.
