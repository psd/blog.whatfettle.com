According to <a href='http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html'>The World's Smallest Political Quiz</a>, I'm an out and out leftie. Even though this goes against the findings of more detailed quizes taken in the past (see <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000006.html'>Holier than Thou</a>), I'm now a legitimate target for the <a href='http://www.strauss.za.com/sla/leftie.html'>The Leftie Insult Generator</a>.
