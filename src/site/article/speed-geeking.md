<p>And so to <a href="http://www.eu.socialtext.net/wikiwed/index.cgi?london_wikiwed_4_july_2007">WikiWednesday</a>, a <a href="http://londonwikiwed.ning.com/">regular</a> <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/211996/">event</a> where fifty-odd geek boys and girls and suites came together to discuss the ways of the wiki. Last night the main topic of discussion revolved around locking pages down (my take: if you lock all the pages, it's probably no longer a wiki) followed by some nice lightning talks, I particularly enjoyed <a href="http://distributedresearch.net/blog/2007/07/05/july-4th-wiki-wednesday">Andy</a>'s thoughtful pointers to research on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_practice">Community Practice</a> and <a href="http://distributedresearch.net/blog/social-objects/">Social Objects</a> and their relevance to collaborative online experiences.</p>

<p>But what of the speeding geeks? Well, this was a great opportunity for the <a href="http://www.osmosoft.com">BT Osmosoft</a> guys to introduce themselves and kick off our engagement with the Open Source community with a fun demo.</p>
<p>At the start of the evening we collected people's mobile numbers, entering them as "tiddlers" tagged "geek" into a local <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a> document using a simple Wiki text format. Pressing the <b>ROUND!</b> button in the <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2007/06/speed-geeking.html#SpeedDate">SpeedDate</a> tiddler shuffled and dealt the geeks into pairs in a new <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2007/06/speed-geeking.html#SpeedDateRound1">SpeedDateRound</a> tiddler. Pressing <b>RING!</b> caused the pairs' phones to be connected together, leaving them to chat and try to work out where the other person was in the room. We started cautiously with 2 pairs and built up in several rounds ending up with cacophony and confusion as 20 mobile phones rang at once. YouTube video to follow.</p>

<p>Thanks must go to all who took part, <a href="http://www.bearingpoint.com/portal/site/bearingpoint">Bearing Point</a> our generous hosts and the <a href="http://sdk.bt.com">BT SDK</a> team for enabling us to mess around with the phone system in such a frivolous way :-)</p>

<blockquote>If you want to run this for yourself, have a play with the <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2007/06/speed-geeking.html">TiddlyWiki</a> page  - to add your own tiddlers, save as source and reload the local copy of the page in your browser. To make phones ring you need to deploy a <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2007/06/call.phps">simple HTTP proxy</a>. I use HTTP/S and Basic Authentication to secure a my copy on whatfettle.com, but you can run yours wherever - localhost is fine. Register an application with the <a href="http://sdk.bt.com">SDK</a> to get a certificate, and install it along with a copy of the PHP5 SDK on your web server. Finally, change the URI in the <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2007/06/speed-geeking.html#ContactMacroPlugin">ContactMacroPlugin</a> tiddler from web21c.whatfettle.com to point to your deployment.</blockquote> 

<i>Update: There's now a simplified version <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2008/02/SpeedGeeking/">available</a> which uses <a href="http://mojo.bt.com">BT Mojo</a>.</i>
<i>Update: BT closed down Mojo and the <a href="http://web21c.bt.com">Web21C SDK</a>, we expect to build a version of SpeedGeeking with <a href="http://ribbit.com">Ribbit.com</a> when it's possible to use Ajax to make UK phones ring.</i>
