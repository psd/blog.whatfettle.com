<a href='http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/'>DaveO</a> does the math and explains to <a href='http://webpages.charter.net/chrisfer/blog.html'>ChrisF</a> why <a href='http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2005/01/04/why_bittorrent_isnt_good_enough'>bitTorrent isn't good enough</a>.  Something fairly noticable is how often folks in meetings find it easier to toss large files across a desk on a USB key even though everyone might be hooked up on Email, IM, etc.  A big file, say an hour long VCD recording still takes a long old time to transfer over a 11Mbs wireless LAN as opposed to a few minutes via a 512MB key. Anyway needless to say many of us Brits are uncomfortable with the 'BT' abbreviation for bitTorrent.  Oh, and if you want a copy of <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/3755686.stm'>The Power of Nightmares</a>, toss me that key next time we meet :-)
