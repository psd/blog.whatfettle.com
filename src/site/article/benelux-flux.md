Ever since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_treaty">Shengen Treaty</a>, boarders in the Benelux countries are less of a thing.  All the same it may come as a surprise to the Dutch that according to Google's new European map, they've swapped territory with Belgium.</p>

P.S. I love the way Redcar and Whitley Bay, of all places, make it onto the Zoomed out UK map, ahead of Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Leeds, York, etc, etc.</p>
