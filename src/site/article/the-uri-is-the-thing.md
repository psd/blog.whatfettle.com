For more influences, see my <a href="http://psd.tumblr.com/">Scrapbook</a>.</p>I was disappointed not to come up with a clear metaphor for separating representation from interaction. After publication, <span class="vcard"><a href="http://hawksworx.com/" class="fn url" rel="friend co-worker colleague">Phil Hawksworth</a></span> suggested a vending machine with XML, HTML, JSON, etc radio buttons, which would have worked nicely. I also spent far too much energy exploring the dark side, in particular faux Web technologies and the dangers of outsourcing your strategy to purveyors of closed source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">lock-in</a>. What I am proud of is the way progress comes from a series of places rather than actions, that is nouns, not verbs. Thus the drawing is itself quite RESTful!<p>This is published under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC</a> license, and is available as high resolution PDF on <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/TheUriIsTheThing">archive.org</a> [<a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/The_URI_is_the_Thing">Digg</a>] [<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/75ija/the_uri_is_the_thing_cool_pen_and_ink_drawing/">Reddit</a>].</p>
