I've enjoyed the Radio 4 series <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/chainreaction.shtml'>Chain Reaction</a>, the premise of the programme is that last week's guest interviews this week's and so on. <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio4_aod.shtml?radio4/chainreaction'>Tonight's episode</a> (sadly not a <a href='http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html'>cool URI</a>) had Brian Eno being interviewed by Alan Moore:

Moore: your choice of luxury on Desert Island Discs wasn't your initial thought of "a lifetime supply of interesting drugs", rather "a giant man eating spider" to keep you alert ..

Eno: no, I don't think that's true! 

Moore: OK, but if you had said that, imagine, then given the current terrorist actuated global situation, have we all been given the luxury of our own giant man eating spider?

Eno: Yes!

I also liked the Noam Chomsky quote "there are now only two super-powers: the USA and world opinion".
