Browsing my out-law's bookshelves I happend on this fun book, published in 1982 by <a href='http://www.readersdigest.co.uk/'>Readers Digest</a> 'The Inventions That Changed The World'.
The fun starts when they describe state of the art telecoms stuff:

<i>"Intelligent" phones call often-used numbers at the press of a button and will divert calls to other numbers.</i>

<i>The ordinary telephone network is used by Printer-com machines to transmit and receive the printed word. They operate four times faster than Telex and the executive case version weighs 18lbs.</i>

All well and good, but it made me look again at a book I bought for the kids earlier this year <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1405302364/qid=1096567789/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-8068606-7457247'></a>:
