<p>A tale of two Travel Bugs, with an update of how I conned a friend into buying paying for sushi ..</p>

<p>Back in November, <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/auburnmarshes/">Jonathan</a> and I in <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000319.html">the land of the rising sun</a>, snuck off as the sun rose, braved giant spiders:
</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/62942726/in/photostream/"><img src="http://blog.whatfettle.com/_25_62942726_ae68b2efbc_m-1.jpg" height="240" width="180" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt=" 25 62942726 Ae68B2Efbc M-1" /></a>

<p>
 and were first to find the <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fd6f7365-03a8-4533-9ad1-68a02dcbacb2">Rinko Park</a> geocache. 
</p>
<p>We didn't have anything much to swap with the great stuff inside:

<p>
so we converted two plastic sushi trinkets into a pair of "fast food" travel bugs, 
a prawn <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?tracker=TBB885">Ebi</a> for Jonathan and pair of sushi rolls, 
<a href="http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?id=48739">Futo Maki</a> for me:

</p> 
<p>
And so began <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/auburnmarshes/Blog/cns!1pYfT3LzkL-w_fqWjbBi-0sw!353.entry">"The Great Sushi Race"</a>:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/62943868/">

</a>
<p>Right from the outset I had a distinct advantage, with <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/auburnmarshes/blog/cns!F985A6952BC07C4!364.entry">Ebi heading off to south Japan</a> and <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/auburnmarshes/blog/cns!F985A6952BC07C4!447.entry">South Korea</a>, whilst Futo Maki made a beeline for Narita and then landed in the UK near Sheffield. The last hop was the most tricky, but again I had the advantage with my home cache being in <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=2fcb84fc-e7b4-431f-9ee6-595a0802432b">an urban environment</a> and Jonathan's literally in <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC4F0C">Back of Beyond</a>. For that reason alone I feel bad about claiming the prize. Well, bad-ish :-) </p>

<p>You can see the story so far in <a href="earth.google.com">Google Earth</a> courtesy of <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2006/06/thegreatsushirace.kml">this kml file</a> - I say so far because of course Ebi is still at large.</p>

<p>I'm indebted to <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/auburnmarshes/">Jonathan</a> for the TB tags and doing a far better job of recording updates of the race. We should get to meet next week at the <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/events">WS-I</a>. Pity about the quality of the <a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/2002/09/Blog/2005/01/06#2005-01-sfo-visit">sushi In Ottawa</a>, maybe <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/auburnmarshes/blog/cns!F985A6952BC07C4!489.entry">double or quits</a> is a better bet!</p>

<p>So Jonathan paid out at <a href="http://www.wasabisushibar.ca/">Wasabi</a>, here in Ottawa, after an evening geocaching. We had a witness in the shape of  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/172662433/">Ram</a>, and very nice it was too! I particularly liked the "too cute to eat" <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/172660530/">octopus salad</a>. As soon as Ebi is within reach, we'll have to cook up another race for a return match.</p>
