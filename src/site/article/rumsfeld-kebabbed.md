Spotted on several blogs including <a href='http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/2004/03/18/rummy_lying_on_camera'>Dave Orchard</a> - Donald Rumsfeld being nicely Kebabbed in a <a href='http://www.moveon.org/censure/caughtonvideo/'>TV interview</a>.  I've no doubt who is the biggest "immediate threat" to our safety.  For more Rumsfeld fun listen to his <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/bh/rumsfeld.shtml'>Library of Quotations</a> harvested from Radio4's Broadcasting House.
