<p>In one of the best bits of one of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13_%28film%29">favorite films</a>, a gaggle of back office boys are presented with a bag of unlikely looking parts and told "we have too much CO<sub>2</sub>, this is all we have to work with". The result isn't pretty, but it's good enough. So it is with the Web, when there's a problem, the geeks come up with an answer which doesn't involve launching yet another rocket:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Quick, we need more bandwidth!</dt>
<dd>Bury more fiber? Um, DSL, different coloured lasers?</dd>
<dt>We're running out of IP addresses, and need security</dt>
<dd>Roll out IPv6! Er, what about NAT, and there's this TLS thing?</dd>
<dt>I want animation, GUIs!</dt>
<dd>Flash, Applets! Er, did you know you can call HTTP asynchronously from Javascript?</dd>
<dt>We need Single-Sign-On!</dt><dt>
<dd>You can do that with a little redirection and hashing â€” <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>?</dd>
</dt><dt>You can't use certificates inside a browser!</dt>
<dd><a href="http://prooveme.com">You can't?</a></dd>
<dt>The Web is for people and I want Web Services!</dt>
<dd>Er, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Why?</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>And so it continues. The story of the Web is "good enough".</p>
