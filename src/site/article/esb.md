As heard in this morning's BEA <a href='http://uk.bea.com/events/techtalk/index.jsp'>Tech Talk</a> presentation .. Sorry Gartner, but the term <a href='http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/06/13/24FEesb_1.html'>ESB</a> means only one thing to us brits .. beer! But OK, after a couple of these you're going to be fairly loosely coupled.
