<p>Something which puzzles me deeply is why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altoids">Altoids</a> (mini-extra strong mints and boiled sweets) are unknown in the UK in spite of being manufactured by Callard &amp; Bowser in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgend">Bridgend</a> and available <em>everywhere</em> in the US. I mention this only because we Brits are missing out on a great source material for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/48083484/" title="Photo Sharing">Geocaches</a>,  <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2004/02/22/mostlyMinty">minty piggy banks</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/since1968/73032666/in/pool-altoids/">USB chargers</a> and other <a href="http://www.altoids.com/tin-million-uses.do?area=tin">cool hacks</a>.</p>
