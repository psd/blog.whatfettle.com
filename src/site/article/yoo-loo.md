These scary images arrived in a round-robin email under the apt title "would you use it?".  They're apparently from an art installation by <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1090478'>Monica Bonvicini</a> as reported by <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3257370.stm'>BBC</a> last year, though I think these are from a more recent exhibition in Switzerland. In answer to the question: I'd give it a go, but would mentally recite the 13 times table to stave off the old <a href='http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/Facts/paruresis.htm'>avoidant paruresis</a>.
