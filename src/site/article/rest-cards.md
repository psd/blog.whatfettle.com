<p>At the <a href="http://xmlsummerschool.com">XML Summer School</a>, my marra <span class="vcard"><a href="http://www.java.net/pub/au/59" class="fn url" rel="met friend colleague">Marc Hadley</a></span> and I ran a short workshop on designing <strike>REST</strike> Webby services. We used pin-boards around the room, along with index cards:</p>

<p>which we connected with ribbon to paper-prototype HTTP message flows:</p>

<p>People seemed to like the cards, adopting them as labels:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/4978577897/" title="Jeni and Leigh by psd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/4978577897_b08233b0d0.jpg" width="500" height="382" alt="Jeni and Leigh" /></a></p>
<p>All was going well until someone slipped "204 - No Content" into my badge holder. This made me grumpy, because everybody knows I'm <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324">418</a>.</p>
<p>	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/4967856349/" title="418 I'm a Teapot by psd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4086/4967856349_8cc3327137.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="418 I'm a Teapot" /></a>
<p>I had fun spray-mounting them onto card, and even without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendering">calendering</a>, cutting <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Xcut-Corner-Rounder-Punch-Large/dp/B002BJ0OUE">round corners</a> gave them a pretty nice playing card feel. I might turn them into fridge magnets. Maybe you'd like to, given they're under a Creative Commons License! Anyway,  it's early days, and I'm still not exactly sure where this experiment is going. <span class="vcard"><a href="http://jermolene.com/" rel="colleague co-worker met" class="fn url">Jeremy Ruston</a></span> wondered about tessellation, or even if they could be made to perform work, a bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier's_bones">Napier's Bones</a>?
