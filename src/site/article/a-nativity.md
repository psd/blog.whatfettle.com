<p>Jed (10) has been experimenting with stop frame animation using my old still camera. Most of his movies so far have been short and sweet, and totally barmy. With the girls at the ballet, I took the chance to steer him into telling a story, but in the end much of my input was confined to developing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a> behaviors to keep the truculent Windows Movie Maker gods happy. Happy Christmas!</p> <p><i>Update: YouTube seems to be up the spout, so flipped to Google Video.</i></p>
