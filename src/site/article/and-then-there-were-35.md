Wow! The BBC reports how an <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3583889.stm'>Art Treasure is Confirmed as Vermeer</a>. This brings the total number of paintings atributed to Vermeer to 35 and provides a marvellous excuse to upload some of my pictures of Delft.

A couple of years ago we killed a couple of hours in Delft market waiting for the ferry:

The Mr Fish van where we had a fantastic Herring roll:

Delft dock hadn't changed much:

The Johannes Vermeer cafe:

I'm also reminded of Norm Walsh's excellent <a href='http://norman.walsh.name/2004/02/08/vermeer'>Dinner With Vermeer</a> pictures, where a series of the master's paintings were reenacted as tableaux vivants. Something I'm going to suggest we try as a school fundraiser.
