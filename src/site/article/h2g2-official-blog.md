The new Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Movie has an <a href='http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/main.html'>official Web site</a>, and what claims to be a <a href='http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/hitchblog/blog.htm'>blog</a>, though there is no RSS/Atom feed, so that's useless then. Expectations for the film are very low here in the UK after the way Hollywood mistreated The Italian Job, The Avengers, Thunderbirds, etc. etc.
