I just discovered this in my bag of reciepts from a recent trip: a 100% Hampton guarantee. It's so useful it now perminantly resides in my wallet. For those of you not brought up up a diet of Carry-On films or <a href='http://www.viz.co.uk'>Viz</a> comics or who haven't read my <a href='http://www.worth1000.com/cache/gallery/contestcache.asp?contest_id=2455&amp;display=photoshop'>American Tea</a> post, "Hampton" is British slang for yer "Dick".
