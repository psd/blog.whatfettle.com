Explaining to the kids how a scene in Futurama was inspired by a M.C. Escher drawing, I was surprised how the search results on <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Escher'>Escher</a> included a panel of his drawings.  Seems like a nice new Google feature I thought, but was then unable to get the same results for <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Dali'>Dali</a>, <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Picasso'>Picasso</a> or <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Monet'>Monet</a> although <a>Magritte</a> worked. Hmm were any other artists are given this special treatment? A quick <a href='http://www.whatfettle.com/2005/04/gartists/'>spider hack</a> using a list of artists names from the <a href='http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Art_History/Artists/'>Google Directory</a> found only one other: <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Chagall&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta='>Chagall</a>.  I wonder if this response is triggered by the search data, or if these artists are the favourite ones of some Googlite, beta-ing away deep inside Google towers.
