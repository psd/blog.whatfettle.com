And so to the <a href='http://www.e.bell.ca/filmfest/'>Toronto International Film Festival</a> to see <a href="http://www.e.bell.ca/filmfest/2004/filmsschedules/description.asp?pageID=sched&amp;id=41">Da si gein</a> (Breaking News).

Suprisingly I was one of the first five people to vote for this film on <a href='http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0414931/combined'>imdb</a>, which shows how new the films being shown are. FWIW I gave it a <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/imdb.html'>7</a> - I was worried at first by the A team like shoot-outs, but the fast pace and humour kept us all going, even when the projector bulb went half way through :-/

Most seats sell out quickly:
