A morning jaunt out to the <a href='http://www.amnh.org/'>American Museum of Natural History</a> with Allen. We fronted up too early, so took a stroll around <a href='http://www.centralpark2000.com/database/ramble.html'>The Ramble</a> in Central Park.

We got to see the pond, <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000103.html#more'>again</a>, but this time from the other side:

I was amazed when Allen pointed out turtles basking by the water's edge:

Back to the museum itself:

The stuffed animals reminded me of the <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000027.html'>Tring Museum</a>, though the dioramas were somewhat more inventive.  I questioned how and why people came, or chose to live in such a harsh environment as depicted by "Mammoth Bone Hut":

Allen patiently explained how even if they were aware there was a different life to be had, living in a climate where it never got below 90+Â° might seem like hell to some people.. 

The <a href='http://www.amnh.org/rose/'>Rose Space Centre</a> was quite spectacular:

The Big Bang exhibition in the bottom half of the planetarium sphere had portentous but fun narration by <a href='http://www.mayaangelou.com/'>Maya Angelou</a> which led on to the  <a href='http://www.amnh.org/rose/cosmic-moreinfo.html'>Cosmic Pathway</a>. 

I find the whole experience of being dwarfed by cosmic scale pleasantly reassuring - no matter how we stuff up the planet, we're just a short and tiny blip in the grand context of things. 

I initially though the indented (13) was a fixed typographical error, but I guess it's just for effect:

Earth sciences were a definite high point, gems and jewels aren't usually my thing, but the displays here are good enough to be worth a single visit in their own right. There were some very large <a href='http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/other/meteorites.html'>meteorites</a>, like this 34 ton monster discovered in the arctic, the supports go two floors down into the bedrock beneath the museum:

Allen recognised this lump of iron as coming from Oregon from its name '<a href='http://www.amnh.org/rose/meteorite.html'>Willamette</a>':

But dinosaurs are the thing here, made famous by Ross from Friends, I guess:

i liked the flying turtle:

and the Megaloceros:

and, of course, the T-Rex:
