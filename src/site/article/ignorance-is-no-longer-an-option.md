<a href='http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/'>Tim Bray</a> writing about <a href='http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/08/CIOFunnies'>what CIOs don't know</a> included the choice quote: "The salesperson wrote back saying â€¦ some of us on both sides are wondering what BLOGS stands for." I had a similar reaction to an Email I sent out the other day: I received several replies asking what "<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/'>Infoset</a>" meant, all from people who have no qualms about putting "XML" on their CV. This is something that bothers me greatly. Claiming ignorance of technical terms is just plain lazy now we have the Web and even the dumbest CIO must realise something is significant if it returns 7million pages from <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=BLOGS'>Google</a>.

<i>Update: It appears I didn't calculate for people who implement or defend a corporate <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2006/03/06/freedom-is-slavery/">ministry of truth</a>. An ignorant man will always be a slave.</i>
