<img alt="xearth-quake.jpg" src="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/xearth-quake.jpg" width="425" height="425" border="0" /><p>I did a double-take when <a href='http://www.hewgill.com/xearth/'>xearth</a> popped up this morning, but today's <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4126971.stm'>news</a> is simply quite awful. Hearing that possibly <s>as many as 11,500, more than 15,000</s> 25,000 people have been killed really isn't comprehensible. As trite as it may sound, our thoughts go out to those affected by this terrible tragedy :-(</p><p><i>28-12-04</i>: OK, so I'm not going to keep updating this entry as the death toll rises, that would just be mawkish. Suffice to say it's much, much worse than the initial, terrible reports portraid.</p><p><span class="vcard"><a href='http://www.bloglines.com/blog/sanjiva' class="url fn" rel="met contact colleague co-worker">Sanjiva</a></span>, who everyone involved with Web services knows, lives in Sri Lanka and has brought the tragedy even closer to home through his blog. Good to read that at least his folks appear to have been saved. As <span class="vcard"><a href='http://www.bloglines.com/blog/gdaniels?id=28' rel="met friend colleague co-worker" class="fn url">Glen Daniels</a></span> says, “thank goodness the <a href="http://www.opensource.lk/">LSF</a> guys all seem to be all right”. </p><p>This week seems to be a good time to buy <a href='http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/12/27.html'>Fog Creek Software</a>, if you were already inclined to do such a thing. I'm not exactly sure how I feel about that announcement — generous or just cashing in? It's a really fine line to tread, and I'm aware how pompus even my jottings probably sound to someone right there in the thick of it .</p><p>So here's how to exercise your guilt!
