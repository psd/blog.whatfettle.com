<p>Fun <a href="http://www.gamedesign.jp/flash/worldmap/worldmap.html">quiz</a>, poor score (63 after a couple of attempts). My excuse is that maps have changed quite a bit since my day (where's all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_empire_on_which_the_sun_never_sets">pink</a> gone?). I honestly didn't know Burma had been called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar">Myanmar</a> since 1989!? What saved me more than once were strange half-remembered names from my childhood stamp collection <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenic_Republic">Hellenic Republic</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirate">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">United States of America</a> ..</p>
