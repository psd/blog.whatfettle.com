<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/72057594072218284/">Menton, February 2006</a> is a set of 300 odd photos taken during during a nice weekend with the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/Eljay">Mrs</a> followed by a week of fun and games at <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/12/allgroupoverview.html">The W3C Technical Plenary</a>. I need to write more, and post fewer pictures :)</p>
