From tonight's cracking <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_I_Got_News_For_You'>HIGNFY</a> "Congratulations to President Bush on winning his first election". "They'd be better off with <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/tv/bagpuss/'>Bagpuss</a>".

Bush and Osama need each other, they're like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Ronnies'>The Two Ronnies</a>, "so it's jihad from me and war on terrorism from him, goodnight".
