Much of yesterday was spent implicitly pondering the difference between a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_%28web_application_hybrid%29">Mashup</a> and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration">Integration</a>. The question cropped up in conversation with <a href="http://garethrushgrove.com">Gareth</a>, but came to a head as the <a href="http://www.osmosoft.com">Osmosoftonians</a> investigated the use of <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a> to add an offline experience to an internal system only a vendor account manager could love. Coincidentally, <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com">JP</a> was also yesterday <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2008/02/18/musing-about-enterprise-information-and-flow/">musing about enterprise information and flow</a>, from which my take is the blog is very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software#Criticisms">enterprisey</a> when <a href="http://www.wired.com/special_multimedia/2008/ff_secretlife_1602">charted on a diagram</a>, but that's all hidden, dynamic loosely connected, plumbing. It's a convoluted route when drawn out in plan, but the result of the power of hyperlinks: you don't need <a href="http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm">a map</a> to construct a Web-flow, you just follow the signs.
<p>As a result, I'm pretty sure there isn't a knife-edge, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonconstructive_proof">nonconstructive proof</a>, but when considering calling something a mashup, you might like to ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li id="zero-touch">Is everything "zero touch", that is, can you get to your data without having to engage in a dialog with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobsworth">jobsworth</a> to ask for permission, open up a channel, send you documentation, add users, test data, whatever?</li>
	<li id="safety">Can you play around with the data, view it in a browser without worrying about accidently firing nuclear missiles? In other words, <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2005/10/31/is-it-safe/">is it safe?</a></li>
	<li id="cool-URIs">Is the site stable? Can you send a link to a page to someone else and they, assuming they have access, see the same data? Are the Web pages bookmarkable? That is, does the site use <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URIs</a>?</li>
        <li id="parseable-data">Is the data available in an open, easily parseable form, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformats">HTML with Microformats</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>, etc</li>
	<li id="locked-in-data">Does the site eschew so called <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/05/03/silverfish-and-appallingo/">rich user experiences</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverlight">Silverlight</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Air">AIR</a>, and other proprietary nonsense when presenting data?</li>
	<li id="warning-enterprise-developers">can you access the data from a HTML form, or with a drop of Javascript in a browser, without having to download Jar, War, Ear, DLL, PEAR, Eggs or other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sdk">SDK</a> like stuff?</li>
	<li id="pipeable">Are the URIs accessible from The Web, visible to services such as <a href="http://www.dapper.net/">Dapper</a>, <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo! Pipes</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, i.e. don't involve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Internet_Naming_Service">WINS</a> or other scoped addresses which only make sense behind a firewall?</li>
	<li>Do the words "SOA", "EAI", "SOAP", "WSDL", or heaven forbid "BPEL" crop up during conversation, except within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quotes">bunny quotes</a> and followed by sniggers?</li>
	<li>To protect private data, does the site use <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a>, <a href="http://openid.net">OpenID</a>, a simple <a href="Digest_access_authentication">digest scheme</a> or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">Username, password and cookies</a> rather than some complex, probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity">federated</a>, security method for access control?</li>
	<li id="strach-an-itch">Does it solve a problem for you personally, scratch <em>your itch</em> or help someone you know and care about, rather than being a prospective development to fulfill someone else's perceived requirements for their ideal "user"?</li>
	<li id="fun">Would you ever consider developing the idea yourself, you know, just for the fun of it?</li>
	</ul>
<p>If the answer to <i>some</i> of the above is "no", in particular the first and last ones, then you have an integration on your hands. Bad luck. It's going to be expensive, and certainly not pretty.</p> 
<p>Bumper sticker: <em>Mashup fun? No need to ask!</em></p>
