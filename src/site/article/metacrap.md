It's an old link, but Cory Doctorow's seminal article <a href='http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm'>Metacrap</a> is well worth a read. It explains why search engines are unlikely to start indexing RDF any time soon.

[updated] seems like in Semantic Web terms this is a <a href='http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/straw-man.html'>strawman</a> argument. The Semantic Web doesn't mean "metadata produced by a publisher about his own pages".
