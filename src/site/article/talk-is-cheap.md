<p>There's a great rant in what looked like a great talk from rock stars <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/">Don</a> and <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/">Chris</a>, which <a href="http://galbraiths.org/blog/">Ben</a> <a href="http://galbraiths.org/blog/2007/03/26/mts07-don-box-and-chris-anderson/">transcribed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“It turns out a lot of the headache people have with Web Services or WS-* is tied to XSD. XSD is more flawed than most technologies that roam the earth. I was on the committee that created it, and that was back when I made my money explaining complicated technologies to people for money, and man, I could hear the cash registers ringing in my ears.”

“Now my job is making things simple, which is unfortunate since I’m stuck with XSD.”

“XSD was a standard-committee driven piece of ####ing crap.”</blockquote>
<p>Amen, and thanks to the likes of you we're saddled with the horror of schema. Instead of just moaning, maybe you could put some bums on seats <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/databinding/">over here</a>.</p>
