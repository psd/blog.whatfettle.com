<p><a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/12/21/17594.aspx">Don</a> likes the innovation of a search box top-right in IE7. I wonder how it compares to the gloriously extensible <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/search-engines.php">Firefox Search Engine</a>, or Norm's cool toolbar <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2005/12/21/ysearch">bookmarklet hack</a>. Seems like 2006 is set see another round of browser and search engine wars, and that can only be a good thing for Joe Surf.</p>
