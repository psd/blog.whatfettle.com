<p>Without a doubt, one of the highlights of last year was attending the <a href="https://www.xmlsummerschool.com">XML Summer School</a>, Wadham college. I particularly enjoyed the <a href="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/archives/2006/08/22/hot-in-oxford/">Trends and Transients Day</a> the talks were great and with an audience filled with top industry names the level of debate and Q&amp;A was scintillating, both in the room and later over a pint. Delegates have good access to speakers who make themselves available at the numerous, great, social events.</p> 
<p>So I'm really looking forward to returning, this time as a speaker on <a href="http://www.xmlgrrl.com">Eve's</a> <a href="https://www.xmlsummerschool.com/curriculum/webservices.html">Web Services and Identity</a> track. I'm talking about "Web Services Conventions and Controversies" and hope to make up for my not being <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2006_08_13_seanmcgrath_archive.html#115554764626919071">Sean</a> by combining lots of silly visual abstractions with phones ringing in the room. Also on the track are <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mhadley/">Marc Hadley</a>, <a href="http://appliedlife.blogspot.com/">John Kemp</a>, <a href="http://www.jeff-barr.com/">Jeff Barr</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Salz">Rich Salz</a>, <a href="http://connectid.blogspot.com/">Paul Madsen</a> and <a href="https://www.xmlsummerschool.com/speakers/johnchelsom.html">John Chelsom</a>. Great line up, eh? I also plan to seize the opportunity to work on my understanding of "Identity".</p>
<p>Elsewhere you'd be hard pressed to find better people to learn XML and XSLT from than the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kay_%28software_engineer%29">Michael Kay</a>, <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/">Jeni Tennison</a>, <a href="http://www.datypic.com">Priscilla Walmsley</a>, <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/">Norm Walsh</a>, <a href="http://www.prescod.net/">Paul Prescod</a> and <a href="http://www.snee.com/bobdc.blog/2007/07/come_join_the_oxfordshire_sema.html">Bob DuCharme</a> to name but a few.</p><p>With the <a href="http://swig.networkedplanet.com/">Semantic Web Interest Group</a> and <a href="http://oxford.geeknights.net/2007/july-25th/">Geek Night</a> it's a great week to be in Oxford. So if you're about to book then bother me via Email and I'll send you a code for a speakers' discount.</p>
