<a href='http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2005/02/16/choreography_vs_orchestration.html'>Stefan</a> outs the analogy of the distinction between Choreography and Orchestration. I first heard this along with another analogy relating to a musical score from Steve Ross-Talbot in his <a href='http://www.w3.org/2004/03/TechPlenAgenda.html'>lightning talk</a> "I'll name that tune in ..". I came up with another analogy, which I'm not sure is any better, but here goes:

Orchestration is akin to traffic lights where events are controlled centrally, whereas Choreography is more like a roundabout, where each participant is following a prearranged set of rules.

<i>Update:</i> 
#1 it's Stefan, not 'Steve', d'oh! 
#2 <a href='http://www.jacek.cz/blog/'>Jacek</a> points out that a choreography is far more open ended than orchestration. Participants are encouraged to improvise, if you will.
