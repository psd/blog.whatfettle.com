Pringles are a pretty awful thing. Basically they're like eating deep fried instant potato with a nasty oniony after taste. All in all a million miles from snacks such as <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000129.html'>spicy peas</a> or <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000124.html'>habas mujados</a>. Anyway I digress. What bothers me most about this product are the adverts which claim "once you pop [the lid] you can't stop", as if they're as addictive as crack-cocaine (drinking sea water, more like). If this really is the case, why do they need a resealable lid?
