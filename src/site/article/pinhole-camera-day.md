There was a cracking report on the <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/misc/pin_hole_camera_20040424.shtml'>Today Programme</a> this morning about pinhole cameras. Tomorrow, the last Sunday in April, is apparently <a href='http://www.pinholeday.org/'>World Pinhole Camera Day</a>. There are some great shots on <a href='http://www.pinholephotography.org/'>pinholephotography.org</a> and <a href='http://www.pinhole.org/'>www.pinhole.org</a> which demonstrate nicely the fantastic depth of field obtained thanks to a small aperture and no lens. I'm very tempted to have a crack myself, but after years of using only digital photography I'm loathed to go back to using nasty chemicals.
