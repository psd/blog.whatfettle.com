Last Sunday we visited the <a href='http://www.nmpft.org.uk'>National Museum of Film, Photography and Television</a> whilst in <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000128.html'>Bradford</a>.

There are some great interactive exhibits, including two walls of LEDs which react as you walk past:

these are the TV equivalent of a hall of mirrors:

Jon lay on this bed:

and his image was projected onto a second bed across the room mixed in with dream like images of people swimming:

Worrying that Pac-Man is now a museum exhibit:

The TV Heaven exhibit is going to be killed by video on demand - they have hundreds of old TV programmes which you can watch in a cubical, I chose <a href='http://www.propaganda.com.au/catweazle/'>Catweazle</a> which I must say was still cracking:

Lack of time meant skipping the traditional hangover test - the IMAX cinema. It's nice to note that they now show more mainstream films than endless repeats of <a href='http://www.imax.com/films/now_playing/dream_alive.html'>The Dream is Alive</a>.

The garden themed <a href='http://www.nmpft.org.uk/gonegreen/gallery.asp'>Everything's Gone Green</a> exhibition was fun, I particularly liked the <a href='http://www.hainesgallery.com/JSTE.bio.html'>Joel Sternfeld</a> photos of a disused railway in New York:

The <a href=''>Simone Nieweg</a> exhibition - large format pictures of bare fields and allotment sheds got mixed reviews in the visitor's book:
