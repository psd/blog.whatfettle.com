I'm enjoying the new Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series currently playing on <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/'>Radio4</a>. The Tertiary Phase is 'based upon ideas by Douglas Adams', who also appears thanks to the wonders of digital technology. Most of the original cast appear with <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0291598/'>William Franklin</a> striking the right note as the book replacing the late great <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0429012/'>Peter Jones</a>. You can listen to the current week's episode again via the <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/index.shtml'>BBC Microsite</a> which has a ton of other stuff including a nice video of how the third series was made. A fourth, presumably final, series is to be aired in May 2005.
