The <a href='http://www.w3.org/2005/03/xml-schema-user-program.html'>Program</a> (shouldn't that be Programme, I'm no longer sure) is now available for next week's W3C Workshop on Schema 1.0 User Experiences. As you can see there are some interesting papers. The Agenda is fairly fluid and open, in particular for the second day, the idea being that we'll set the agenda based upon issues brought out in presentations and prioritised by those in attendance. So it should be an interesting event. I'm particularly looking forward to hearing people's views in the 'way forward' section.
