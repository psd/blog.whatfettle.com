<p><a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arungupta/">Arun</a> is a great guy and so I'd heartily recommend going to see his <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arungupta/archive/2007/05/javaone_2007_ba.html">keynote demo</a> and session "<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arungupta/archive/2007/05/ts4865_takes_tw.html">It Takes Two to Tango</a>". What a perfect name! It sure does! I have a vision of an audience watching uncomfortably as two vendors dance strangely and skilfully just to get it on. Watch out for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1jywlZG74o">the big orange guy </a> when the music stops because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_%28drink%29">you'll know when you've been tango'd!</a></p>
