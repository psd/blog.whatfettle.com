<p>As anyone who spends time flipping between Windows, Cygwin, Unix and other worlds knows, punctuation is annoying. My brain is hard-wired to type '/' in path names as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ken_n_dennis.jpg">the good lords</a> intended, and not '\' as some CPM-DOS-wallah picked just to be different. I wonder why Java can't just use ';' as a universal CLASSPATH separator, but the one that's pressing my buttons today is the "Santa Claus [santa@northpole.org]" format taken by Outlook (v) "Santa Claus &lt;santa@northpole.org&gt;" as used by most everybody else.  All I can say is *@!#?!</p>
