<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/3699406174/" title="Geekery is The Social Capital of Britain by psd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3431/3699406174_dce81f73c1.jpg" width="500" height="382" alt="Geekery is The Social Capital of Britain" /></a><p>Blame <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/">JP</a>, who asked me to put together a poster on behalf of <a href="http://www.osmosoft.com">Osmosoft</a> to celebrate the <a href="http://tg2009.com/">Traveling Geeks</a> visiting BT. The brief was to "incorporate said geeks, BT and Cool Britannia".  After some head scratching, and a wrong turn involving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Pranksters">The Merry Pranksters</a>, I landed on this attempt at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Norden">John Norden</a> map of things which might interest a geek visiting Britain, seen from the perspective of the BT Tower.</p><p>The original plan was to have copies to hand out at the event, but after leaving it up until the wire, and a saga involving a taxi dash and two broken scanners &mdash; it's hand drawn with pen and ink on A2 cartridge paper &mdash; we went with a photograph blown-up to B0 which the geeks signed on the night.</p><p>It's fair to say the reaction from the geeks on seeing my pathetic attempt at representing them as angels and cherubs was a little "<a href="http://www.cnewmark.com/2009/07/do-i-look-like-that.html">mixed</a>", but what the hey, I did have fun trying!</p><p>A cleaned up high scan of poster is available on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/3699406174/">flickr</a> under the creative commons and as a <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/GeekeryIsTheSocialCapitalOfBritain">PDF</a> for print which is dedicated to the public domain, so fee free to copy, clip, mash it up however you see fit, and although it's pure <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/10/24/on-the-vanity-of-demanding-attribution/">vanity to demand attribution</a>, the odd link to this blog post would be nice!</p><p>As for the locations, I'm particularly indebted to <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2008/Oct/8/london/">Simon Willison's</a> <a href="http://icanhaz.com/londonguide">London for Geeks Google map</a> and the lovely O'Reilly <a href="http://www.geekatlas.com/">Geek Atlas</a> which has greater depth and a wider scope, but actually no map! There are quite a few references with one or two allusions, in-jokes and random acts of love to be found in the drawing, and given the density of the picture I don't think I'll be able to use flickr notes to build the annotations as with my <a href="http://thewebisagreement.com">other drawings</a>, rather I've a cunning plan involving <a href="http://osmosoft.com/cecily/">Project Cecily</a>.  So watch this space!</p>
