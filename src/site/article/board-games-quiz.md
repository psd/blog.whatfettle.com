<p>Another year, and another quiz sheet for our local school Spring Fair. The theme of this year's fair is "The Beijing Olympic Games". Sigh! So each picture represents a game. A board game. Hmm. And it's not as cryptic as previous years. Double hmmm. As usual, I'll post the answers after the prize draw. <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/Quiz/#Games">Have Fun!</a></p>
