Hmm, first my mrs gets me with "there's a mouse in the hallway", then I start to believe the Today Programme on 'King Tom' but finally <a href='http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200504/msg00000.html'>Sean</a>  gets me hook line and sinker. I have therefore earned my son's badge which I will now wear with pride until noon â€¦ happy April 1st everybody!
