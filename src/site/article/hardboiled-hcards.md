<a href="http://whatfettle.com/2010/01/Hardboiled/" title="Hardboiled hCards"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2753/4273317821_ec78fe622d.jpg" width="500" height="240" alt="Safari 4" /></a><p>I recently came across <span class="vcard"><a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/" class="fn url" rel="met">Andy Clark</a></span>'s <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/could_you_be_a_dick/">could you be a dick</a> competition. Andy's book "<a href="http://www.transcendingcss.com/">Transcending Web Design</a>" is a lovely explanation of the value of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/">graded browser support</a> which together with his advocacy of <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>, his <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/dear_taylor_swift/">open letter to Taylor Swift</a> and the CSS3 and Web typography goodness on <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/">for a beautiful web</a> has made me something of an unashamed fan. I already have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/4178247123/">S&amp;N pin</a> and a chance of contributing to his next book was too good to miss.</p><p>But, and you must have known there was a big fat but coming, I don't have sufficient ready cash, hard-disk space or time to play Adobe Photoshop updater tamagotchi. Like many people, I make stuff using a browser and not vendor tools from a parallel universe. It's an approach outlined in Andy's own presentation: "<a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/walls_come_tumbling_down_presentation_slides_and_transcript/">Walls come Tumbling Down</a>". All this led to a self-corpse-munging of a conflicted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robby_the_Robot">Robby The Robot</a>-esque proportion: <i>a business card .. as an image .. for a Web design book .. a business card as an image .. for a Web design book ..</i></p><p>That conflict cost me time and now the competition is closed with the <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/i_the_jury">results declared</a>. So I've put what I might have entered here:</p> 
<p><a href="http://whatfettle.com/2010/01/Hardboiled/">http://whatfettle.com/2010/01/Hardboiled/</a></p>
<p>This is just a bit of HTML marked up as <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a> meaning you can use Firefox operator or a service such as <a href="http://h2cx.com">h2cx</a> to <a type="text/directory" href="http://h2vx.com/vcf/whatfettle.com/2010/01/Hardboiled/">download vCards</a>.</p><p>As you can probably tell I'm no rock-star Web designer and am scared silly by the notion that means I should <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/keep_calm_and_carry_on_with_html5/#r4094">COMPLY WITH STANDARDS</a>. I did however, have a bunch of fun playing with some of the new CSS properties appearing in modern browsers. These work to varying degrees in a different browsers as illustrated by a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/72157623083466151/">collection of screen shots</a>:</p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/72157623083466151/" title="Hardboiled Set by psd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4274771102_cc40e56b49_o.png" width="478" height="240" alt="Hardboiled Set" /></a><p>I also took the time to ensure the page contained <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwhatfettle.com%2F2010%2F01%2FHardboiled%2F&profile=css21&usermedium=all&warning=1&lang=en">valid CSS</a> and <a href="http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwhatfettle.com%2F2010%2F01%2FHardboiled%2F&showsource=yes">valid HTML 5</a>.</p><p>The source, including attributions for fonts and the couple of royalty free images used is up on <a href="http://github.com/psd/HardBoiled-hCards">github</a>. If someone cared enough we could start adding in hacks and work-rounds to solve some of the glitches for <a href="http://IE6isOlderThanYourGrandpa.com/">the hard of browsing</a>. What would be cool is if the markup was the same across all the cards, independent of the stylesheet used. I guess that's my next challenge.</p>
