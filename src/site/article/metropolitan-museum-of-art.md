Another attempt at finding some modern art in NYC - after the meeting Jonathan and I hacked off to the <a href='http://www.moma.org/'>MOMA</a> only to realise the collection had been moved to Queens during the refurbishment, so then took a cab to the Guggenheim, <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000103.html'>again</a>, only to discover it was closed thanks to a water leak. So we were due some good karma, which we found in abundance at the <a href='http://www.metmuseum.org/'>Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>.

There was an exhibit up on the roof from <a href='http://www.metmuseum.org/special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId=%7B6DD7F1A6-061A-4A92-998A-494C621A2CBD%7D'>Andy Goldsworthy</a>. The domes weren't that great - they lost their impact thanks to a crowd of yuppies drinking cocktails, but I was mightily impressed by his naturalistic work as described in detail by Jonathan described and will definitely be looking out for his work here in blighty:

There was an amazing exhibition for Christo and Jeann Claude <a href='http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/tg.html'>The Gates</a>. This project will mark 23 miles of pathways in Central Park with 7500, 16 foot high gates each draped in orange material.  The art was bizarre, but we particularly liked the photos of committee and planning meetings which led up to the approval - all a strange echo of the standards meeting we'd just spent three days attending. The project starts in February 2005.

Also excellent were the Frank Lloyd Wright room, the African art and the extensive collection of modern paintings.

I liked the Met pin, but can't really recommend AT&amp;T call cards, they play an advert before connecting you, bah!
