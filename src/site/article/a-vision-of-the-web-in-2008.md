<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/2155825176/" title="A Vision of the Web in 2008 by psd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2371/2155825176_c00b7d446a.jpg" width="500" height="337" alt="A Vision of the Web in 2008" /></a><p>As someone who previously <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2005/05/27/2050-immortality/">poured scorn</a> on someone calling themselves a futurologist, I surprised myself by being disappointed by a dearth of predictions on the blogsphere this New Year. So here's my attempt to fix this, and keep <span class="vcard"><a href="http://www.kerrybuckley.com" rel="met colleague co-worker friend" class="fn url">Kerry Buckley</a></span> <a href="http://www.kerrybuckley.com/2008/01/01/happy-new-year/">company</a>. Whilst reading this tosh, please note that I'm working on the <span class="vcard"><a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson#Attributed" class="fn url" rel="muse">William Gibson</a></span> principle that the future is already with us, it's just unevenly distributed. So this doesn't account for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">Black Swans</a>. Also being something of a complete <a href="http://www.softwareas.com/designing-like-a-pollyanna-have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too">Pollyanna</a> there are no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_botnet">Storm Botnets</a> or tales from the dark side in my rather swirly <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/2155825176/">Vision of The Web in 2008</a>:</p>

	<dd>Forget the lockin promised by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application">Rich Internet Applications</a> no matter how shiny they might be, and to some extent ignore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget">widgets</a> and gadgets, the darlings of the moment and look out for some really cool site specific browsers. Adding a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_%28computer_security%29">sandbox</a> to get around <a href="http://log.does-not-exist.org/archives/2007/12/28/2160_when_widgets_go_bad.html">security concerns</a> and a support for offline with some <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2007/12/12/stale">cluey caching</a> to the likes of <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/">Prism</a> or <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluidapp</a> and you've something more than <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/03/30/houston-we-have-an-opportunity/">good enough</a>!</dd>
	
	<dt id="lifestreaming">Lifestreaming</dt>
	<dd>We've had glimpses of this pattern in <a href="http://www.jaiku.com">Jaiku</a>, <a href="http://www.onaswarm.com/">onaswarm</a>, <a href="http://lifestre.am/">lifestre.am</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>'s attention stream, but if you jam <a href="http://360.whatfettle.com">all your feeds</a> into one page, and then add all your friends' feeds, the result isn't all that compelling. I can't quite believe <a href="http://www.apml.org/">APML</a> is the magic sieve which will make lifestreaming useable, but have no doubt this area will see interesting advances in 2008. </dd>
	
	<dt id="OpenData">Open Data</dt>
	<dd>Following from lifestreaming, that rich 'mericans motivated to put their bank account details into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesabe.com">single web site</a> just to make sense of their worth, comes as a surprise to many in blighty. We'll continue to hear from people <a href="http://www.dataportability.org/">demanding ready access to their own data</a>. Bigcorp, you might think of yourself as the custodian of my bills, appointments, phone records, texts and phone messages but it's my data, and I want it as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom</a>, <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>, <a href="http://www.elite.net/~runner/jennifers/thankyou.htm">thankyouverymuch</a>!</dd>

	<dd>Once people are motivated to collect their streams in one place, then we might finally see social networking <i>aggregation</i> rather than portability. I'm still waiting to see what <span class="vcard"><a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/" class="fn url" rel="met friend colleague co-worker">Kevin Marks</a></span> and <span class="vcard"><a href="http://bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem/" class="url fn" rel="colleague">Brad Fitzpatrick</a></span> are really working on as I <a href="http://twitter.com/psd/statuses/383592972">still can't really believe</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">Open Social</a> was it. I'm betting some simpler patterns will emerge for combining <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> with <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a> to slurp your contacts into a new app, <a href="http://blog.dopplr.com/index.php/2007/06/23/importing-your-social-network-from-other-sites/">Dopplr style</a>.</dd>

Pointless point-to-point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity">Federation</a> will continue to be ignored whilst <a href="http://www.openid.net">OpenID</a> in version 2 will continue to make progress as people finally realise <i>authentication</i> doesn't always have to equate to <i>trust</i> and <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/01/urls-are-people-too.html">URIs are people too</a>.</dd>

	<dd>Searching for anything to do with games results in pages of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_blog">splogs</a> containing Google and other splash ads. Someone is paying for this nonsense, and yes it's us when we buy <i>stuff</i>. Maybe with advances in Identity, Social Networks and delegation it will be possible to start <a href="http://light.vpod.tv/?s=0.0.393979">turning the tables</a> on <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</abbr> with <a href="http://www.projectvrm.org/">Vendor Relationship Management</a>, and you know everyone will be the happier for it.</dd>

	<dd>In 2007 <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/psd/mashing-up-the-mobile">we saw</a> the power of combining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">feeds</a>, <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">pipes</a>, with <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>'s abstracted address book, presence done right, feeds and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URI</a> for every message. Twitter continues to be the one to watch precisely because of its simple Web exposure and constraints in the just the right places. As for more responsive eventing, watch out for more on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29">comet</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmpp">XMPP</a>.

	<dd>In spite of one of the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/heidipollock/heidi-pollock-fowa-07">best talks</a> at this year's great <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps</a> repeatedly using the popularity of <a href="http://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/razr/">my sucky phone</a> as an example of why mobile web development is so hard, I haven't been bitten by <a href="http://twitter.com/psd/statuses/440211722">my desire for an iPhone</a>, mainly due to it being closed platform and not 3G, and not having GPS. An iPhone with all three would truly be a game changer. Fingers crossed.</dd>
	
	<dt id="OSS">Open Source</dt>
	<dd>Strategy used to be the process of looking at your suppliers, putting your eggs in one basket or trying to divine some kind of lowest common denominator across a set of vendor roadmaps. Adoption of standards were seen as the best way of ensuring you could switch suppliers. With Open Source that's no longer the case. As everyone now knows, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovation-Happens-Elsewhere-Business-Strategy/dp/1558608893">innovation happens elsewhere</a>, and in 2007 that was from a myriad of small but significant Open Source projects. In a nutshell: "<a href="http://twitter.com/psd/statuses/558052082">Vendor led is now dead</a>". This year will continue to witness the snapping up bright things who've taken the industry forward, demonstrating software skills in the open, often from the comfort of their bedroom. We'll also see enterprise developers realising often the best way to achieve widespread adoption of infrastructure code within their own company, as well as reducing the cost of maintenance and support, is by releasing Open Source. One area this still remains a challenge is in the <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2008/01/03/the-problem-with-open-source-design">field of design</a>. Agile development and Open Source haven't always led to good user interfaces or experiences, so I'm hoping 2008 will see better understanding of why <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum/dp/0672316498">The inmates</a> shouldn't continue to run the asylum. That's certainly something we're thinking about a lot over in <a href="http://www.osmosoft.com">Osmosoft</a>.</dd>

	<dd>My 2007 was punctuated by <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/03/05/w3c-workshop-on-web-of-services-for-enterprise-computing/">a</a> <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/03/15/qcon-soa-v-rest-slides/">series</a> <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/07/12/xml-summer-school/">of</a> <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/03/29/show-me-the-interoperability/">frank</a> <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/10/19/end-of-an-era/">farewells</a> to the silly world of <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/11/19/best-practice-for-web-services/">Web services</a>. Sadly for some still stuck in the Enterprise Software Swamps, the <a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2008/01/debate-on-rest-vs-ws.html">debate apparently rumbles on</a>, but for me in 2008, the war is over, and beyond wrapping up the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/databinding/">databinding</a> work, I won't be sullied with SOAP, or its stupid squabbling, and I'm so happy about that!</dd>
	
	<dt id="Facebook">Facebook--</dt>
	<dd>They hit the big time in 2007 by opening up deservedly grabbing <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=facebook+site:confusedofcalcutta.com&hl=en&start=0&sa=N">significant attention</a>, then made <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2007/12/09/facebook-facebook-facebook/">a whole bunch of mistakes</a>, and yet we're all still there. With <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_%28Facebook%29">Beacon</a> demonstrated how they only see us as captive eyeballs on adverts. As <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> nicely put it "advertising used to be about bullshit in your face, now your face is bullshit". They'll continue to learn and slowly reinvent themselves, we've seen a little of this already with the welcome <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=23">data feeds</a> and back-peddling on content-free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacn_%28electronic%29">bacn</a>, but as long as they try to lock you in by owning your "graph", they're doomed to be replaced by someone more deserving of our trust.</dd>

	<dd>Finally, a rather wishful goodbye to the schismatic influence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techcrunch">TechCrunch</a> and the current crop of similar egocentric commentators. It's somehow ironic how much of Web 2.0's supposedly wise crowd can't fail but unthinkingly echolalia the agenda of the so-called 'A' list bloggers. I'm sure they're all super-nice guys, but PR Bullshit 2.0 is still PR Bullshit and you know that when the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6IQ_FOCE6I">bubble pops</a>, it'll be all over their faces.</dd>
