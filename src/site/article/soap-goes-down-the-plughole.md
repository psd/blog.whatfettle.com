<p>On one level <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/12/google_depreciates_SOAP_API.html">Google deprecating</a> their <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/soapsearch/reference.html">SOAP Search API</a> is vexing because it means a lot of people will have to change their hacks. On the other hand it's such an obvious step in the right direction; I've never understood why it wasn't a simple GET of an XML document. It seems that <a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2002/04/24/google.html">Paul has been proved right</a> at long last. <i>Update: Looking at the alternative <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/">AJAX Search API</a>, it requires hosting their Javascript inside a Web page. That's quite limiting!</i></p>
