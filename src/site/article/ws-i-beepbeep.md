<p>A number of people have been asking me about the <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/">WS-I</a>, what's happening, in particular if the <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/deliverables/workinggroup.aspx?wg=requirements">WS-I Requirements Working Group</a>, is a good place to get relief from the pain of Web services. My answer: it's a toy steering wheel not attached to the drive train, designed to keep the kids happy. Go ahead, bang on the horn, but don't expect anything rewarding to happen as a result.</p>
