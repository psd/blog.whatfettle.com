<a href="http://www.pacificspirit.com/">Dave</a> pinged me last night to ask if <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> could build annotated albums like <a href="http://www.pacificspirit.com/photos/">his own</a>. After a fruitless search, I lashed up a quick <a href="http://gallery.whatfettle.com/?photoset=530987&#38;cols=3&#38;size=small">gallery</a> web app which whilst not ideal for his purposes, was fun to write. If you like it, either use the URI directly, generate HTML and host that on your own site, or  hack and deploy the <a href="http://www.whatfettle.com/gallery/index.phps">php source</a>. It depends upon <a href="http://www.phpflickr.com/">phpFlickr</a></p>
