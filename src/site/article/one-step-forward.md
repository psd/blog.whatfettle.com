<p>Kudos to Yahoo! for finally starting to roll out <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/auth/">BBAuth</a>, a simple consistent authentication scheme across their services. This is one of a number of different but similar attempts at providing a simple Web based identity scheme. <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=d72faa5c-c997-4b9e-b5a7-6638df3d1e72">Dare</a> squints hard and spots the difference between this and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForWebApps.html">Google's Web Proxy Authentication</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/148632387/">photo</a>), but I've lumped them together with the <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/08/18/pilgrim.html">Atom PP technique</a> as "HTTPS/URI Hashing" in a recasting of <a href="http://www.pingidentity.com/about/management">Patrick Harding's</a> <a href="http://blog.pingidentity.com/blog/default/?permalink=Differentiation_between_Identity_Protocols.html">Diagram</a> (above).  BBAuth does enable interesting interactions between third-parties, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity">federation</a> if you will, such as <a href="http://www.moo.com/">MOO</a> printing private photos from my <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> stream. But I still feel it's not a lot further to the top right than say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Passport">Passport</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/148182303/in/set-72057594138378559/">photo</a>).</p>
