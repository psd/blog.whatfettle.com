And so to the <a href='http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/'>New York Public Library</a> for a spot of culture. Jonathan had a few minutes before catching a  train so we scooted around the <a href='http://www.nypl.org/research/newton/'>Newton Exhibition</a> too quickly to do it justice (plus I was knackerd and took next to nothing in). After saying goodbye I ended up in one of the fantastic reading rooms. These are great places to sit down and get a spot of work done. Spacious desks, power, but I didn't get a sniff of the <a href='http://www.nypl.org/branch/services/wifi.html'>free wireless</a>.
