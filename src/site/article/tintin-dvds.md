As a part of Tintin's 75th anniversary, Anchor Bay have released a boxed set of all 21 of the animated episodes which <a href='http://www.play.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=R2&amp;title=163423'>play.com</a> are selling for only £22.99! This represents excellent value at ~£1 an episode, though it's worth pointing out they're the American voiced versions and not the famous 60's cod-French accent 5 minute shorts "Herge's Adventures of Tin-Tin"…
