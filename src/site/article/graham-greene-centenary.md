One hundred years ago today Graham Greene was born in <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/cat_berkhamsted.html'>Berkhamsted</a>. Shame he's no longer with us to celebrate or watch the evening of programmes <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/greene-centenary.shtml'>BBC4</a> are showing in his honour.
