Congratulations to Canada on winning the ice hockey <a href='http://www.hockeycanada.ca/e/teams/mens/worldcup/2004/results/091404_canfin.html'>World Cup</a> beating Finland 3-2. Although the match was played downtown, tickets for such a big game are harder to come by than rocking horse droppings, so we retired to a pub in Unionville to watch it on TV. Thanks to <a href='http://www.pacificspirit.com/blog/'>DaveO</a> and <a href='http://www.cs.yorku.ca/~ryman/'>Arthur</a> I had half a clue what was going on and now know what "One Timer" and "Power Play" means. A couple of hours later and I can still hear a few mad Canucks out and about waving flags out of car windows and banging their horns. It's more Torino than Toronto really.
