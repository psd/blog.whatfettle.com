First impression of Ottawa is that it's pretty flat and fairly empty.

Looking out of my hotel bedroom window this morning I was confronted with the sunrise, something that's not usually so obvious back in blighty thanks to all those hills, and trees and houses that tend to get in the way of the view. 

Watching the sun visibly rise into the sky really gives a strong sense of the earth turning and a feeling that home is back east, a long way over that horizon:

Anyway that injected yet another ear worm and I now have <a href='http://www.rolfharris.com/'>Rolf Harris's</a> "Sun-er-ryzee earlie in de mornin" playing on my psychic jukebox.
