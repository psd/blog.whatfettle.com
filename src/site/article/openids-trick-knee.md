<p>Don't get me wrong, I love <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>, even now it's <a href="http://www.identityblog.com/?p=668">famous</a>, and use <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com">mine</a> <a href="http://openid.net/wiki/index.php/Public_OpenID_providers">wherever I can</a> and sometimes <a href="http://claimid.com/psd">where I probably shouldn't</a>, but there are some risks which many don't seem to be aware of. The first is that it doesn't kill <a href="http://www.antiphishing.org/">phishing</a>, well not without <a href="http://identity20.com/?p=87">some help from the browser</a>. The second is like all URIs, it relies upon DNS, which is worrying not so much because the centralised registry <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6338261.stm">can get hacked</a>, but because it's easily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack">spoofed</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_poisoning">poisoned</a>. Please don't tell me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRI">XRI</a> is the answer, we really need <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC">a more trustworthy DNS</a>.</p>
