At last! We're on the <a href='http://maps.google.co.uk'>Google Maps</a>, though as my mate Pete noticed, we're strangely located in the middle of the Atlantic. No arial photos, as yet, but at least I can now join the fan club headed by <a href='http://www.bloglines.com/blog/gdaniels?id=40'>Glen</a>. One interesting feature Jonathan noticed, the US version now also returns addresses in the UK. That's going to confuse all those 'mericans, somewhat searching for directions from "<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.125000,-95.110082&amp;spn=34.312500,74.032115&amp;saddr=auburn&amp;daddr=807+4th+St,+Oswego,+KS+67356+(Watts+Art+Studio)&amp;hl=en'>Auburn</a>".
