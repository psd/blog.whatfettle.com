<p>I dread playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_%28game%29">Monopoly</a> because it always ends in tears. Usually mine. But these <a href="http://wiki.playagaingames.com/tiki-index.php?page=MonopolyHomeRules">house rules</a> are great, and should go a long way towards stemming the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimation">lacrimation</a>.</p>
