Back from the cracking <a href='http://www.xmlopen.org'>XMLOpen</a> conference - given the quality of the speakers and delegates it was more like a summit or symposium.

Some highlights:

<a href='http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/relax/'><img alt="relax-ng.jpg" src="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/relax-ng.jpg" width="124" height="148" border="0" /></a>

Meeting Murata Makoto and hearing so much about <a href='http://www.relaxng.org/'>Relax NG</a> - I'm well impressed and intend to explore W3C to Relax mapping tools in preparation for <a href='http://www.ws-i.org/docs/charters/Schema_Plan_Charter1-0.pdf'>WS-I Schema Work Plan</a>, if it ever gets off the ground. Give Kal Ahmed's <a href='http://www.techquila.com/rng-tools.html'>documentation tools</a> a whirl.

<a href='http://www.schematron.com'><img alt="bilby.jpg" src="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/bilby.jpg" width="100" height="204" border="0" /></a>

Getting a bilby pin from <a href='http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5334'>Rick Jelliffe</a> was nice. <a href='http://www.schematron.com/'>Schematron</a> looks cool and I've already several applications for this useful technology in mind including <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnxml/html/schematron.asp'>Embedding Schematron in W3C Schema</a>. Of course <a href='http://www.dsdl.org/'>DSDL</a> is building a very nice ISO standard framework around Relax NG and Schematron. Alex Brown gave a good introduction to the effort and <a href='http://www.jenitennison.com/'>Jeni Tennison</a>'s talk on datatypes was brilliant.

<a href='http://www.xmluk.org/slides/cambridge-2004/optimal-xml-mcgrath.pdf'><img alt="sean.jpg" src="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/sean.jpg" width="200" height="245" border="0" /></a>

<a href='http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/'>Sean McGrath</a> gave great value with 2½ talks and bonhomie at mealtimes. I was mightily impressed by his common sense regarding XML processing and I'm carefully reading and digesting the <a href='http://sdec.reach.ie/rigs/'>RIGS</a> (Reach Interoperability Guidelines). Look out for a video of his keynote speech themed on simplicity, elegance and complexity appearing on the <a href='http://www.xmlopen.org'>XMLOpen</a> site - it was cracking. <a href='http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/2004/9/24'>Edd Dumbill</a> thought it raised more questions than answers. I felt differently, coming away even more resolved to fight the power. Complexity is rarely the best or only solution to a complex problem!

Sean's pipelining talk struck a chord with my mate <a href='http://jroller.com/page/smithap'>Adrian</a>. It's the architecture we've used on several successful systems. Small independent boxes strung together asynchronously are the only way to build large and reliable systems. 

<a href='http://groovy.codehaus.org/'><img alt="groovy-logo.png" src="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/groovy-logo.png" width="227" height="112" border="0" /></a>

<a href='http://uche.ogbuji.net/uche.ogbuji.net/caramusis/'>Uche Ogbuji</a> on processing XML in Python and <a href='http://wilson.co.uk/'>John Wilson</a> on XML in Groovy both provided good stuff straight from the horse's mouth. 

<a href='http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/'>Harry Halpin</a> and <a href='http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~ht/'>Henry Thompson</a>'s paper on <a href='http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~ht/webpropernames/'>Web Proper Names</a>. Henry is always good value and willing to present ideas during their formation - it certainly got people talking!

John Merrells talk on business models for Open Source software was great food for thought … thinks … thinks …

I missed Peter Rodgers talking about <a href='http://www.1060.org/'>1060 NetKernel</a>, but there was more than a little buzz afterwards, so I'll be looking that up too. 1060 if you did but know is the value of XML as Roman numerals.

On a personal note, I hope my spiel on versioning went OK. I have to admit to being a little nervous going on first thing and slightly phased looking out at some of the celebs in the audience. Slides and examples <a href='http://whatfettle.com/2004/09/XMLOpen/'>here</a>.

So, kudos to Eamonn and Alex for putting on a top conference in a top location - I'm certainly looking forward to the next one!
