<p>I'd written <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> off as uninteresting when he appeared to recycle Paul Graham's XTech talk on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html">How to Be Silcon Valley</a> into a <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/06/how_to_kick_sil.html">US centric bullet list</a> with no attribution, but after watching the video of <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/06/the_art_of_the_.html">The Art of the Start</a> he's right up there with Larry Wall's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StateOfTheOnion">State of the Onion</a>. As for Mr Graham, well, he missed his European audience by the <a href="http://gc.kls2.com/cgi-bin/gc?PATH=SFO-AMS&#38;RANGE=&#38;PATH-COLOR=&#38;PATH-UNITS=mi&#38;SPEED-GROUND=&#38;SPEED-UNITS=kts&#38;RANGE-STYLE=best&#38;RANGE-COLOR=&#38;MAP-STYLE=">5,473 miles</a> he'd flown to patronise them with his parade of marginally offensive racial stereotypes.</p>
