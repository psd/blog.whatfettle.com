<p>
It's a meme-thing, here are my 12 cut and paste sentences from last year:
<br />
<br /><b>January</b>: based upon an accident of birth
<br /><b>February</b>: choreography is more like a roundabout
<br /><b>March</b>: "why aye, mon cherie", "au revoir, pet".
<br /><b>April</b>: wear with pride until noon
<br /><b>May</b>: Yes, it's eternal life
<br /><b>June</b>: hats off to Helen Steel and David Morris 
<br /><b>July</b>: the "war on flies^W terror"
<br /><b>August</b>: go on and on well past the point of smelling iffy
<br /><b>September</b>: I've been immortalised
<br /><b>October</b>: fire up a dentist's drill, slap you around the face
<br /><b>November</b>: our glorious leader gets a kick up the jacksie 
<br /><b>December</b>: my defensive action had insulted the driver
