<p>So <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/03/mail.html">there's now</a> <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/mail/code/">an API to Yahoo! Mail</a>, which we understand for historical reasons is very simple, minimal SOAP and WSDL, but:
<blockquote>Not all languages that support SOAP are compatible with the Yahoo! Mail Web Service, but all languages that support JSON-RPC are.</blockquote>
</p><p>If the reason you're using WS-* is interoperability with tools, then it could be time to rethink that new  legacy you're building.</p>
