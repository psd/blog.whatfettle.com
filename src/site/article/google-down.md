Well that's a first - <a href='http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Service+error+-27%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search'>Google</a> currently returning an error instead of search results. 

Update: now the subject of a <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3927963.stm'>BBC report</a>. Looks like a myDoom mutant is hammering Google here in the UK. Sadly reported on the Radio 4 19:00 bulletin as 'Google is suffering from a virus attack'  which gives the mistaken impression that Google runs Microsoft software :-(

Update: an explanation from <a href='http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/07/global-worming.html'>Google</a>  isn't that impressive - I got the error from work and home, as did several others in the UK.
