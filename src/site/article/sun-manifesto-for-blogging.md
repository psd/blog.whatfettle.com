This is something quite important: a big public company has published a <a href='http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/02/PolicyMaking'>manifesto</a>   encouraging its own people to blog. This is real employee empowerment! I've not met <a href='http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/'>Tim Bray</a>, but I'm very impressed with the difference he's apparently making at Sun. That is not to say I think Tim is some kind of super-human new broom, just that I'm now  aware of his views and efforts via his interesting blog. Tim makes Sun sounds like a great company to work for in the same way <a href='http://scoble.weblogs.com/'>Robert Scoble</a> does a great job evangelising for Microsoft - by giving a faceless corporate entity a real and likeable human voice.
