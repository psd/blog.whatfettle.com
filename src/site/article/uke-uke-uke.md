Mark Coles <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/arts/ukulele_20040204.shtml'>reports</a>  the rise in popularity of the Ukulele. <a href='http://www.ukuleleorchestra.com/'>The Ukulele Orchestra</a> of Great Britain play covers of everything from "Anarchy in the UK" to "Ms Dynamite". Apparently the Ukulele acts as 'bullsh*t meter' for the strength of a good tune.   Meanwhile in the US <a href='http://www.brookadams.com'>Brook Adams</a> has a number of MP3s on his site, I particularly like his rendition of <a href='http://www.brookadams.com/jumping-flea/sounds/purple-haze.mp3'>Purple Haze</a>. Sheer class.  Googling for Ukulele leads to a whole universe of nutters not least <a href='http://www.mycomputerhatesme.com/utup/index.htm'>Uke Til U Puke</a> who aim to create a "ukulele wall of sound".

Ultimately I'm reminded of the old joke about the difference between a ukulele and a trampoline ..  </i>you take your boots off to jump on a trampoline</i>
