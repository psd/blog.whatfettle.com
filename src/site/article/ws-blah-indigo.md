I really like <a href='http://www.gazitt.com/OhmBlog/'>Omri</a>'s excellent <a href='http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=34980#34980'>video</a> on the Microsoft Web services vision.  However I did feel discomfort in the notion that only a dozen people in the world will need to really understand all these specs because code will hide all the complexity. That's a massive underestimate if this stuff really is successful. I also felt uncomfortable at the REST <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man'>straw man</a> argument.

Rather strangely about half way through I was reminded of the <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/g/goodnessgracious_66601650.shtml'>Goodness Gracious Me</a> character "everything comes from India": "WS-Policy - Indigo!, WS-Transfer - Indigo!" .. stupid I know, but there you go ..
