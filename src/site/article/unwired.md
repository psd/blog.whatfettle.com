OK, this is neat. Last night, after some very nice <a href='http://www.sakaesushi.com/'>Sushi</a>, we wondered over to the Apple store where I parted with Â£60 and became the proud 2nd owner of an <a href='http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/'>Airport Express</a>. On return to the hotel, plugged it into the wall and the hotel network and without any fuss or bother found myself able to surf whilst lounging on the bed.  Other uses abound, not least the mains adaptor reduces the amount of wires in my backpack - I'm also keen to try it out plugged into the stereo at home playing music from the laptop - all in all a good buy!
