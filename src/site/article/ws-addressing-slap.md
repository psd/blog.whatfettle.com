I wanted to blog something about my joining the <a href='http://www.w3.org'>W3C</a> <a href='http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/addr/'>Web Services Addressing WG</a> and so went looking for inspiration using Google image search. Imagine my surprise when the first image returned for <a href='http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=ws-addressing&amp;btnG=Search'>WS-Addressing</a> was a picture of a large trout! Ouch! More usefully, 'i feel lucky' for "Addressing" returns <a href='http://www.w3.org/Addressing/'>this page</a>.
