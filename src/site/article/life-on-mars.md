<p>You know it's ages since there's been something I've wanted to watch on telly, but hidden away amongst hour upon hour of "I'm a Celebrity, Please Nuke this Island", "My Colonic Makeover", "Top 100 Cheap TV Programmes of All Time" and wall-to-wall imported Lost-the-plot wannabies, there's the corking <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lifeonmars/">Life On Mars</a>. OK it's clich&#233;d, as deep as a shag-pile carpet and as cheesy as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wotsits">cheezy whatsit</a>, but hey, that's the fun! A world without colour TV, mobile phones, computers, paramedics  when PC was what you called your very non-PC no-nonsense walking-the-beat copper abetted by Sweeney-Todd-style DC's ('shad-it, you slag!'); when men were men, lasses were lasses, pink-wafer biscuits were pink-wafer biscuits and Mark II Escorts roamed the earth. Oh, how far we've come. Recommended!</p><p><i>Update: it seems I can't spell cheezy!</i></p>
