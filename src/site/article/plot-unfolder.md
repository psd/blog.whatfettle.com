<p>I was sorry to be unable to attend <a href="http://noisydecentgraphics.typepad.com/design/2010/10/papercamp-2.html">Papercamp</a> not least because it's barely a couple of weeks since visiting the lovely <a href="http://www.conwayhall.org.uk/">Conway Hall</a> for a day of cross disciplinary frolicking. <a href="http://www.thisisplayful.com/programme-10">Playful</a> was a blast, resulted in a couple of pages of rather <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/5021471192/">wordy</a>-<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/5021470298/">sketchnotes</a> and inspiration falling out of the lugholes. One Playful thing in particular really caught my attention, <span class="vcard"><a href="http://www.volumique.com/blog/" rel="colleage" class="fn url">Bertrand Duplat</a></span>'s <a href="http://www.volumique.com/blog/?p=27">Night of the Living Dead Pixels</a>, a lovely combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">Choose Your Own Adventure</a> stories with pocketbooks, 2d bar codes and iPhones. QR Codes are kinda cool, the integration with phones is interesting, but it's the papertech that fries my ham:</p>

<p>Back at home we had some fun making our own versions, Jed recreating Die Hard and Phoebe devising a virtual pet:</p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/5057017740/" title="Gimmie Food! by psd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5057017740_18d0b9f9b7.jpg" width="500" height="472" alt="Gimmie Food!" /></a>
<p>All good fun but the unconstrained nature of these makes books them hard construct, fold, unfold and refold.</p>

<p>So I wondered about a version more easily to mass-produce and came up with a "Plot Unfolder", a 3x3 printed double-sided on A4.</p>

<p>My own, rather random plot unfolder "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/72157624918864551/">Finding Nero</a>" was made by doodling, scanning, <a href="http://gist.github.com/442683">converting to SVG</a> and uploading images to <a href="http://finding-nero.tiddlyspace.com/">TiddlySpace</a>:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://finding-nero.tiddlyspace.com/#book">HTML</a> <a href="http://finding-nero.tiddlyspace.com/book">printable page</a> works well in Safari, Chrome and Opera, but needs more work before it'll degrade gracefully in browsers lacking support for CSS transforms and <code>image/svg+xml</code> from an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. This, sadly, includes Firefox 3.6. In the meantime I've cooked up a [<a href="http://finding-nero.tiddlyspace.com/book.pdf">PDF</a>] for the hard of browsing.</p>
