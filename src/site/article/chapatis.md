Home alone tonight whilst Lucy goes off gallivanting. Staring a ready-made spinach and paneer curry full in the face I was inspired to knock up three chapatis.  I'm always amazed how easy they are to make, and given how good they are, wonder why I don't make them more often. <a href='http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=hi&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=bon+apertit&amp;btnG=Google+%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%9C&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryIN'>bon apertit</a>
