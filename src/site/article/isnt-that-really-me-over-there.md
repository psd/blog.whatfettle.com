<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/506402839/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/207/506402839_ac693007f9.jpg" width="500" height="177" alt="dbpedia" /></a><p>I really enjoyed the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">linked data</a> <a href="http://dannyayers.com/2007/05/24/linked-data-again-again">session</a> at <a href="http://www2007.org/prog-Developers.php">WWW 2007</a>:</p><ul><li>Use URIs as names for things</li><li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names</li><li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information</li><li>Include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things</li></ul><p>All Webby goodness! What's not to like? But one issue has stuck in my head since asking the obvious question:</p><blockquote>It seems that folks like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> and <a href="http://api.twittervision.com/api.html">Twittervision</a> offer different representations of the same resource using different URIs .xml, .json, .php, .yaml, etc. I'd say that's arisen because users have little control over content-negotiation in their browser. Isn't having the same resource identified by lots of different URIs an issue for the Semantic Web?</blockquote><p>At the time <span class="vcard"><a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/" rel="met colleague co-worker muse" class="fn url">Timbl</a></span> offered the same answer as <span class="vcard"><a href="http://dannyayers.com/" class="fn url" rel="friend met colleague">Danny Ayres</a></span>, use <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL/">OWL</a> to say the two URIs are the same:</p><pre>    &lt;http://DBpedia.org/resource/Berlin&gt; 
        owl:sameAs 
    &lt;http://sws.geonames.org/2950159&gt;
</pre><p>But isn't it be better just to use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.14">Content-Location</a> HTTP header in the reference? I'm almost ready to contemplate embracing RDF, but does that really mean I have to grok someone else's out-of-band <a href="http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm">metacrap</a> just to process it?</p>
<p>I'm also baffled why more RDF folks aren't embracing <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>, seems like every world changing demo I see still uses usernames to identify users, not URIs. What's that all about?</p>
