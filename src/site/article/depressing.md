</iframe><p>Day 4 and the experiment continues. I've had some interesting feedback, in particular from <span class="vcard"><a href="http://blog.iclutton.com/" rel="met friend co-worker colleague" class="fn url">Robbie Clutton</a></span> who says “yeah, it's kinda OK, but you really are depressing!” And he's right! Yeah, I've been a bit sorta depressed, or depressive for quite a while now and I think it's probably directly attributable to a few things, but top of the list would be lack of hacking. I miss hacking, I love quick, nasty, dirty, but fun hacks and I don't do any of that any more I seem to have descended into being a project manager [and not a very good one at that!]. Brrrr. Anyway, hopefully tomorrow will be more upbeat because I'll be at <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Apps</a>. Way-hay!</p>
