<p>Another <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/politics">political quiz</a>, this time from a dating agency and with the X axis flipped. I'm down as a "Socialist" and as someone who exhibits "a very well-developed sense of Right and Wrong and believe in economic fairness".   Sadly, I seem to be less permissive than <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000283.html">previously</a>. My favorite one of these tests is the <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000006.html">Political Compass</a></p>
