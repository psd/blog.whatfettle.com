<p>I continue to adore Google Maps, but am puzzled by the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/#GPolyline_code_">GPolyline function</a> which draws a spline along an array of longitude/latitude pairs. Unfortunately a line drawn between London and Melbourne appears straight (in red) on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator projection</a>, whereas I had to enumerate a series of points to make the correct curved line (in green). I doubt I'm smart enough to get a job at Google, but at least I know the earth is round :-)</p>
