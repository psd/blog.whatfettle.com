The other week we took the boat to Greenwich to see the Tintin exhibition at the <a href='http://www.nmm.ac.uk/'>National Maritime Museum</a>.

The embankment ferry strangely stops first upstream at Westminster:

under the millennium wheel (my wide-angle lens makes the wheel look like it's raked backwards):

Then off downestream past the Globe theatre:

and beyond Tower Bridge:

Turning around at Greenwich there is a nice view of the Naval College with the Maritime Museum and Observatory behind:

We almost had the same view as Canaletto:

Disembarking at Greenwich pier:

A picnic on the cobbles outside the Cutty Sark and Brunel's tunnel. They were building a ramp up the steps ready for the London Marathon:

Off walking through Greenwich:

The Maritime Musem is the former Naval Hospital:

The entrance hall has a nice full sized model of Professor Tournesol's shark submarine:

Possibly inspired by this photograph of from Herg√©'s collection:

I liked the poster of Haddock's rants:

One of the plus points for me and Lucy getting together was our combined collection of Tintin books had no overlaps:

So we just had to buy the special edition of "Tintin Haddock et Les Bateaux" by Yves Horeou and translated by Michael Farr:

The book overlaps Farr's own excellent <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0719555221/qid%3D1042733201/sr%3D2-1/ref%3Dsr%5F2%5F3%5F1/202-1227592-8332621'>Tintin - The Complete Companion</a>.  All in all the exhibition is great with lots of models and fun displays. Our companions for the day (not obsessive fans like us) enjoyed it too!
