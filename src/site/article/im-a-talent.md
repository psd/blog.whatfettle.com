<blockquote>You're a risk-taker, and you follow your passions. You're determined to take on the world and succeed on your own terms.  Whether in the arts, science, engineering, business, or politics, you fearlessly express your own vision of the world.  You're not afraid of a fight, and you're not afraid to bet your future on your own abilities.  If you find a job boring or stifling, you're already preparing your resume.  You believe in doing what you love, and you're not willing to settle for an ordinary life. Talent: 59% Lifer: 33% Mandarin: 44%
