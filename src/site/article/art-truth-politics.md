<p>I'm not much of a fan of <a href="http://www.haroldpinter.org">Harold Pinter</a>'s plays. Let me rephrase that: I'd seriously consider gnawing off something important if I was made to sit through <a href="http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&#38;UID=1449">The Birthday Party</a> again, and his <a href='http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/2005/pinter-lecture.html'>lecture</a> on accepting the Nobel prize for literature is a corker. However, I much prefer the <a href="http://private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=poetry_corner&#38;issue=1144">abridged version</a> <i>rated 12A</i>.</p>
