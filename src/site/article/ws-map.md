Via <a href='http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/02/17/rest-feet-forward/'>Danny</a>,  a <a href='http://www.w3c.or.kr/~hollobit/roadmap/ws-specs/map.htm'>map of the WS-* universe</a>. The navigation isn't very Firefox friendly, but all the same, it's a nice piece of work and has motivated me to revisit my own pet project to visualise the relationships between WS-* specifications and the people behind them.
