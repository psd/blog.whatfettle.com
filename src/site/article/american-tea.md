<img alt="orangetea.jpg" src="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/orangetea.jpg" width="150" height="170" border="0" /><p>As a retort to <span class="vcard"><a href='http://norman.walsh.name/' class="fn url" rel="friend met colleague">Norm Walsh</a></span>'s nice story about <a href='http://norman.walsh.name/2003/10/05/coffee'>English Coffee</a>, here is my own reciprocal experience:</p><p>I arrived in the Hampton Inn (<a href='http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk/search.asp?expressionid=143&amp;keyword=Hampton%20Wick&amp;method=slang'>Fnnnr Fnnnr</a>)  late at night and just a little worse for wear. Actually I was feeling more than a little bit jumpy. The air was as dry as a bone, the carpets were nylon and the sadists who built the hotel had selected metal door handles and light switches. Everything I touched resulted in an ark of static. I was staying in a van-de-graph generator.</p><p>I really could murder a cup of char. So I fired up the coffee machine (bad sign, no boiling water)  and fumbled for a tea bag… bleugh … rosy lea it wasn't. Words fail me!</p><p>The coffee was OK, thank you.</p><p>Actually I later found some packets also labelled 'orange tea' which was more like it.  I shouldn't make fun. Blame it on the jet lag.</p>
