I have thus far studiously avoided commenting on Web services here, that's my day job, but <a href='http://www.tbray.org'>Tim Bray</a> is bang on the money in his post on <a href='http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/26/WSTandP'>Web Services Theory and Practice</a>. Not a single word in there with which I disagree. Amen brother!
