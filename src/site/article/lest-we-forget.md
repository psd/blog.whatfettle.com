<p>It's fascinating how people <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000017.html">evaluate risk</a>. I'm heartened to hear reports of an increase in cycling following last week's bombs on public transport, that seems like a positive outcome, more so than, say driving a car. So whilst last night's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4684453.stm">Trafalgar Square Vigil</a> was totally appropriate and quite moving, it bears reminding that in 2003 <a href="http://www.rospa.org.uk/factsheets/index.htm">3508</a> people were killed on Britain's roads, that's 9 deaths per day. Where was their vigil?</p>
