Reading the obituaries for Robin Cook I was struck how well his <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,6903,1544393,00.html">resignation speech</a> stands up today. He'll be missed, and not just by the likes of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/deadringers_cast.shtml">Dead Ringers</a>.
