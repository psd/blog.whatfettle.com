<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a> has announced the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/xsdb/">XML Schema Patterns for Databinding Working Group</a>. This follows discussions at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/06/21-schema-workshop/chairs-report.html">W3C Workshop on XML Schema 1.0 User Experiences</a>, and  will hopefully address concerns raised by the formation of the <a href="http://www.ws-i.org/deliverables/workinggroup.aspx?wg=xmlschemaworkplan">WS-I Schema Workplan Working Group</a>. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/ws-databinding-charter.html">Charter</a> lays out the problem to be solved and the scope of the work nicely: essentially we are going to collect patterns of XML Schema 1.0 which should work well with toolkits and document them with test cases.</p>
<p>As Chair, I hope to keep the ball rolling fairly within the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">W3C Process</a>, however as a <i>member</i>, I'm keen to see that the patterns published don't alienate those of us who continue to prefer to continue to work with XML directly. Then there's that all important mention of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/03/plenary-minutes#Session2">versioning</a>.</p><p>Finally, of course, without good participation, the working group doesn't really exist and so I'd encourage anyone with a steak in the interoperability of Web services to seriously consider joining.</p>
