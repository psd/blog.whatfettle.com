Tourist is as tourist does, so it was off to Battery Park to catch the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.

The ferry rolled quite alarmingly in the swell:

but was fine once we got underway. It's not that apparent that Manhattan is an island until you get out into the Hudson river:

The sun was cracking the deck open, hence your author dons a hat:

These binoculars are familiar, though I couldn't find the classic 50s B&amp;W photograph that made them famous:

Sadly since 9/11 it's not been possible to climb up inside the statue:

The view back to Manhattan is supposedly much the same from her feet as her head:

<a href='http://www.ellisisland.org/'>Ellis Island</a> is interesting, but didn't have the emotional impact on this Brit that it obviously has on most Americans. I did, however, like the exhibition, in particular its emphasis on the cultural and ethnic diversity of the immigrants:

And so back to Battery Park:
