Rather than single out someone contemporary I've decided to cite a personal hero <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper</a> who created what is generally considered to be the first compiler, developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC">FLOW-MATIC</a> later standardised as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> a programming language still in common use today and who popularised the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_bug">computer bug</a>. She is also famous for cool visualisations in particular her nanoseconds, lengths of copper wire the distance light travels in a nanonsecond which she handed out to her students. What's more she achieved all of this in a world of institutional discrimination against women and whilst working inside an authoritarian bureaucracy, which is probably why she is often attributed with the quote: "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to seek permission". The breadth of her accomplishments led to her earning the nickname "Amazing Grace", and I think she's someone to admire, regardless of the gender you happen to abide in.  </p>
