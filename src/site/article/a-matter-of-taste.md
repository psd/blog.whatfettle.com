Actually, that's a blatant lie. I think I saw one once, but can't find it again. Anyway, I thought it would be an interesting experiment to show folks both logos and see what they thought and by “folks” I didn't mean Web 2.0 junkies, rather real people, the kind <span class="vcard"><a href="http://gavinbell.com/" rel="met friend colleague" class="fn url">Gavin Bell</a></span> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/gavin/gavin-bell-data-portability-for-whom-xtech08">does a great job</a> of reminding us about, and who typically don't <a href="http://twitter.com/kerryb/statuses/864945638">have a polarised view of Microsoft</a>.</p>Now this evidence is obviously unscientific and highly anecdotal, but of the three sets of people I tested, nobody recognised either, <i>and I didn't tell them what they were for</i>, all preferred <class="<a href="http://www.ydnar.com/" rel="colleague" class="fn url">Randy Reddig</a></vcard>'s OpenID logo and uniformly everyone decided the Infocard “shiny splodge” was the obvious result of a corporate following their conventional <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU9YeOQm3Y0">Usual Design Process</a>.<p>Another interesting aspect came from comparing the URIs for downloading the icons. OpenID went with the rather predictable <a href="http://openid.net/logos/">openid.net/logos</a>, but the best I could find for the Information Card is the gloriously enterprisey <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ce99e033-39a8-4bc5-9014-60ed0b560d0e&displaylang=en">www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ce99e033-39a8-4bc5-9014-60ed0b560d0e&displaylang=en</a>, obviously an artifact of tooling which doesn't care so much about people's esthetics, memories, sides of busses, or even <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2004/10/27/uris-everywhere/">shower heads</a>, but locking publishers in and hiding them from silly inconsequential details such as The Web. You can fully expect that URI to morph into a different value soon, killing your bookmarks and this blog post. It looks decidedly un<a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool</a>.</p><p>Please, by all means, dismiss this post as me being a flippant kitten, but it's all a matter of taste, and taste matters.</p>
