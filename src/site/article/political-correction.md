<p>I'd love to be able to remain ignorant of US politics, but it's hard to ignore <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arnold_J._Toynbee">a large friendly dog in a small room</a>, and although they have two parties which are identically useless (unlike here in the UK where we have three main parties which are um identically useless), Bush and his posse are without question a morally bankrupt bunch of witless feckers. So it's nice to see them get a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6130514.stm">little slap</a>. Wonder if it'll make any difference.</p>
