So the kids are downstairs trying to do their homework, being berated [encouraged!] by Lucy and I'm upstairs locked in the attic doing my accounts and expenses. [Sigh!] Sometimes I think my personal hell will look like the film <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0088846/">Brazil</a> with me amongst the rows of people all doing expenses and accounts for eternity. Well let's see how long this [experiment] continues, and hopefully the next one will be more cheerful!
