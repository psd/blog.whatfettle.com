Last night <a href='http://www.walkers.co.uk'>Walkers</a> (i.e. <a href='http://www.pepsico.com/investors/annual-reports/2000/pepsico_products.shtml'>Pepsi</a>) ran a TV advert during peak-time announcing an offer of a free "Walk-o-Meter" (<a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000146.html'>pedometer</a>) for anyone visiting their web site. Predictably all I got for the first 10 minutes was "document contains no data" followed later by a polite message (see picture). I'd like to have been a fly on the wall of that machine room :-). Trying again this morning appears to have been successful, though only after receiving several  "error in application" messages â€¦ the <a href='http://www.slashdot.com'>slashdot</a> effect in action! Anyway that leads me onto the next problem - understandably there's a limit of   one walk-o-meter per household and I've three blighters who desperately want one.
