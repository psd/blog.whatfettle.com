Hmmm, I hadn't realised your could "claim" your blog on <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, or yet worked out why you'd do such a thing. Anyway, here <!-- ckey="5B15432A" --><!-- ckey="470900A6" --> goes!

<em>Update: OK, that's cool, I got to mark my <a href="/index.rdf">RDF</a> and <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/index.xml">RSS 1.0</a> feeds as duplicates of the <a href="/atom.xml">atom</a> one, and assign a nice picture of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/54364952/">big nose</a>, however it doesn't seem to be able to add up the number of subscribers, I just lost 30 odd ego-points :-/</em>
