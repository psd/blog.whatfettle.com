i have to confess to sometimes using <a href='http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=compossible'>compossible</a> when according to <a href='http://www.googlefight.com/cgi-bin/compare.pl?q1=composable&amp;q2=compossible&amp;B1=Make+a+fight%21&amp;compare=1&amp;langue=us'>GoggleFight</a> it is indeed <a href='http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=composable'>composable</a> . Hmm, spettling never were my fortay.  Anyway, composable: all we need to do is ensure folks understand the thinking that went into these structures:

when compared to this one:

The first two fit well together to form a cohesive whole, but most importantly can be easily taken apart and reused in other structures. 

The last image is constructed from rubbish concreted together and like so many of the untried or tested specs flooding my hard drive is just land-fill in waiting.
