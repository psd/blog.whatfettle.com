My older two kids have discovered <a href='http://www.bwgame.com/'>Black and White</a> big time. ZoÃ« has decided to be a good god, which is working out OK.  Jed OTOH says he's a "silly" god, which basically involves smashing houses, throwing people into the sea and feeding villagers to his pet tiger. Seems like "silly" really means "evil".
