Last week on a standards telcon <a href='http://www.jacek.cz/'>Jacek</a> confessed over IRC to being addicted to <a href='http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com/'>Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger, Mushroom, Mushroom</a>  having planted that ear-worm in our collective heads I went off to huntdown the other toons that <a href='http://www.mnot.net/'>Mark</a> mentioned to show to my kids. Our favourite being the <a href='http://www.footballbadgers.com'>Footballing Badgers</a>, all rather apposite given I was missing <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3787495.stm'>England (v) Switzerland</a> at the time of the telcon.
