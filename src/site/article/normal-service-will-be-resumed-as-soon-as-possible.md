My blog seems to be under a heavy comment SPAM attack clocking up lots of CPU, and I suspect as a result <a href="http://1and1.co.uk">1and1</a> has decided to periodically serve an alternative page containing the single line <code>CGI-limits reached, please try again later!</code> and a <code>200 OK</code> HTTP response. Yes, they think that's 'OK'! As a result Google's cache no longer has my real content, and I'm looking for an alternative host. <i>Update: Yesterday this blog received over 3000 comment SPAMs, all trapped by <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/">SPAM Karma2</a>, however 1and1 still continue to periodically inject the <code>200 OK</code> error messages and don't see the code as an issue. I'm hoping that moving to a more savvy hosting company will give me more options. See you on the otherside!</i>.
