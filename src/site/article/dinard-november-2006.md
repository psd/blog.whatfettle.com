<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/72157594385593996/">Dinard, November 2006</a> is a set of photos from last week's <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/10/interop2-logistic.html">W3C WSDL Interop Workshop</a>. As <a href="http://auburnmarshes.spaces.live.com/">Jonathan says</a> we worked hard, ate well and even managed to play a little <a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html">werewolf</a>. My only disappointment was not to have contributed as much to the WSDL testing as I'd have liked (I was preoccupied with preparing the Databinding Last Call drafts) and the complete absence of <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2005/03/19/french-onion-sellers/">French Onion Sellers</a>.</p>
