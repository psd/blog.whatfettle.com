<p>The other week in Boston, I spotted a sign in Burlington Mall advertising "Simon Guest Services". Instinctively I reached for my camera only to be pounced on by a couple of uniformed guards. They 'advised' me to put my camera away as  photography is strictly forbidden. Negotiation was futile; any attempts at humor wasted. Well it seems photographer <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035555243@N01/29091806">Thomas Hawk</a> also had such an experience and as a result there is a photo meet at noon today on <a href="http://multipledigression.com/bush">Bush Street</a> (how ironic!). Pity I'm  8 timezones away, 'cos I'd love to join them!</p>
