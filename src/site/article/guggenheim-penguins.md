Yesterday Jonathan and I took the subway uptown to the <a href='http://www.guggenheim.org/new_york_index.shtml'>Guggenheim</a>.  The building from the outside was still quite exciting, though in need of a lick of paint. I  was left wondering where the penguins were hiding.

Unfortunately the museum is closed on Thursdays, and the Design museum next door closed early, so we headed back to the hotel through Central Park, which was nice!

We then met up with Arthur and Dave and trooped off to Times Square for a bite to eat 'family style'. I say bite, but they delivered the salad on a wheelbarrow.
