With an hour to spare before my flight I just had time to take a look around the <a href='http://www.whitney.org/'>Whitney</a>.

In amongst the bonkers, but mostly fun, modern installations were some very good photographs, in particular I liked the Mississippi collection by <a href='http://www.alecsoth.com/'>Alec Soth</a>.
