I'd heard of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea'>bubble tea</a> before but this was my first encounter with the trendy drink. <a href='http://www.bloglines.com/blog/gdaniels'>Glen</a>, who seems seriously addicted, took us out to find a fix. We eventually descended upon a <a href='http://www.tasty168.com/'>tasty168</a> franchise in a large oriental mall near to the meeting. I went with the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro'>Taro</a> flavoured black tea which was very nice, though I spent most of the afternoon with a weird sensation of little balls rolling around in my stomach..
