A few people have blogged how they now use <a href='http://www.bloglines.com'>bloglines</a> as their feed reader and after only a couple of days I'm also a convert.  I have to use a different computer for work and home so a web based aggregator removes synchronisation issues.  It's very easy to use and I actually prefer the interface in particular the way it marks items as read to the many desktop clients I've tried. What's more it works well with Mozilla, my browser of choice  and imported my existing channel list from my FeedDemon OPML file. Adding feeds is a quick cut+paste of the RSS/Atom URL or you can click on a 'subscribe with bloglines' icon.  Only worry is they're bound to start charging for this excellent service.
