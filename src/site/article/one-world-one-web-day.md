There are no less than <a href="http://www.onewebday.org/base/index.php/OneWebDay_in_a_box">40 suggested ways</a> you can participate, including signing up as one of <a href="http://onewebday.org/base/index.php/OWD_Ambassadors_2008">100 daily ambassadors</a>.</p><p>For my part as today's ambassador, I shied away from telling a single, personal story about how the Web has impacted me, because that's a continual thing, and decided instead to draw a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/psd/2731067095/">poster</a>. This started out as a series of “Home Sweet Home” sampler like mottos, drifted through some gentle Web homilies and ended up in fire and brimstone: “You're going to hell, RIA and RIAA lovers!”.
