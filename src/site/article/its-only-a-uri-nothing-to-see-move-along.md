<p>I liked and mostly agreed with <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/141/REST-Tips-Prefer-following-links-over-URI-construction">prefer following links over URI construction</a>, well at least for creating resources â€” a POST to a form is often much better than letting anyone build their own URI and PUT a new resource. However I don't think there's any harm in letting people template and guess URIs when it comes to GET, after all that's how HTML forms work. Following links is fine, in particular when accompanied by context such as an XML element name, a Microformat rel or a RDF arc, but you don't need to encounter a link to find a location on Google maps. You see <a href="http://rest.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OpacityMythsDebunked">URIs are opaque, except when they aren't</a>.</p>
