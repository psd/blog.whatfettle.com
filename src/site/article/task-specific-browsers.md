<p>Most of the <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/01/04/a-vision-of-the-web-in-2008/">vision of the Web for 2008</a> seems to be coming true, which means it was either highly portent or most likely, already advent. I'll do a full round up at the end of the year, but in the meantime let me game the game by pimping one of the laggards: <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/01/04/a-vision-of-the-web-in-2008/#SSB">Site Specific Browsers</a>. In the prediction, I cited <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/">Prism</a> and <a href="http://fluidapp.com/i/dock_large.png">Fluidapp</a> already, which in essence build a browser for a single site, giving you a separate icon in your taskbar. Then there are the full sized widgets, applications dedicated to reskinning a site <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">Mailplane</a> for reading SPAM, <a href="http://desktop.ebay.com/">eBay desktop</a> for finding scammers and <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twiteriffic</a> for <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/07/20/25-words/">frittering your life away</a>.</p><p>All fine and dandy, but wasn't really what I was getting at. A few months ago. A friend, who shall remain nameless, was showing me something cool on his laptop. As he typed the web address into Safari I remarked on the risk of, ahem, interesting URIs dropping down, to which he joked "don't worry, I always use Firefox to surf for pr0n". That joke revealed two great  user stories:</p><ul><li>Firstly, performing all your internet banking in a Site Specific Browser is a great idea if that browser is tied to a single bank's site and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandboxes</a> your passwords, cookies, cache and history from other instances of the browser or widgets.</li><li>Secondly, a "Task" or "Subject Specific Browser", an instance of your current browser you flag for researching "butterflies", <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22muppet+death+metal%22">Muppet Death Metal</a>, or <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%22+things+googled+today%22">whatever</a>, which then collects a compartmentalised subject specific cache and history for later mining, or cleansing, would be useful. Really useful.</li></ul><p>Do such things already exist? Yes or no, expect them to be big!</p>
