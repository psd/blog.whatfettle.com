<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/1304602/">Yokohama</a> is a set of 425 odd photos snapped during last week's W3C meetings in Japan. There's also a group <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ws-japan05/">pool</a>. The key to great photography is the ability to edit your own work, a skill I definitely lack. On the other hand it's the raw record of a stream of consciousness that I like best about the whole <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> thang, a condition I seem to be having trouble controlling. Enjoy!
