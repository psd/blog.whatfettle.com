An evening at <a href='http://www.fifteenrestaurant.com/fifteen/'>Fifteen</a>, <a href='http://www.jamieoliver.net/'>Jamie Oliver's</a> charity restaurant. I was surprised to realise it was behind the Old St BT office which I worked in for a couple of years and close to the pub famous in the folk song "up and down the city road, in and out the Eagle, that's the way the money goes, pop goes the weasel".

All I can say is the food and service was excellent, we had no complaints whatsoever, and it's well worth supporting this fantastic establishment!  Apparently we missed Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston by one night. Bah - they missed us more like :-)
