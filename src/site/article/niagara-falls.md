After the meeting <a href='http://www.xml.com/pub/au/213'>Hao</a> was kind enough to give me a lift to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Falls'>Niagara Falls</a>.

The approach from upstream heightens the sense of anticipation:

Looking over the edge was exhilarating:

I liked the way the light shines through the water as it thunders over the lip:

No kidding!:

The town above was a right old eye-sore.

Though offers a nice panoramic view of both falls:

We were amazed how the falls are <a href='http://www.niagaraparks.com/nfgg/geology.php'>eroding backwards</a> at a rate of ~1 metre per year. Give it a hundred years or so and they'll leave the town well and truly behind.

Being a part of the production line leading onto the <a href='http://www.maidofthemist.com/'>Maid of the Mist</a> was fun, the ticket price includes a free plastic raincoat (recycled afterwards):

It's genuinely quite thrilling getting up close and personal to the falls. I particularly enjoyed the moment when the boat makes to turn downstream and starts to 'ferry glide':

Further downstream we stopped at various vantage points to take in the view, this massive eddie is known as <a href='http://www.niagaraparks.com/nfgg/aerocar.php'>The Whirlpool</a>:

This dam seemed to be on the US side with most of the visible power lines headed into Canada:

Hao was surprised to read about a battle here between the Americans and the Canadians (actually the Brits during the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812'>War of 1812</a>):

After the falls, Niagara by the Lake was tranquil - you could just about make out Toronto and the CN Tower:

Visible to the naked eye, but not done justice by my old camera:
