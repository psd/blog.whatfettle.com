<p>If you're reading this from work, then you're lucky enough not to have an employer stupid enough to use the <a href="http://www.websense.com/global/en/ProductsServices/WebsenseEnterprise/
">websense</a> filter. As of this morning, <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com">whatfettle</a> is categorised as 'an inappropriate message board or club'. They also apparently block <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> because it contains 'pornography', which rather misses <a href="http://flickr.com/guidelines.gne">the point</a>. Of course you'd expect any company whose stock in trade is 'innovation' or 'communication' to never consider enlisting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Truth">Ministry of Truth</a> to keep its staff ignorant. But you'd be wrong.</p>
