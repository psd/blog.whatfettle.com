This was similar to <a href="http://www.nigelcrawley.co.uk/">Nigel</a>'s <a href="http://twitter.com/on_radio4">on_radio4</a>, but with attached iplayer metadata. It also has a really cool name "<strike><a href="http://twitter.com/CharBotGreen">CharBotGreen</a></strike>" "<a href="http://twitter.com/CharBotGreen2">CharBotGreen2</a>" which is an egregious pun by Damien on everybody's favourite Radio 4 announcer "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Green">Charlotte Green</a>". My small contribution was to create her icon, a play on Futurama's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama)">Bender</a>. Charlotte is well known for her sense of humour, so we were pretty sure she'd find it funny, but it was still something of a relief and simply wonderful to hear her reaction with Chris Vallance on Friday the 13th's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/pm/">PM</a>:<blockquote>â€¦ but some alter-egos are rather useful, a couple of clever internet folks have Web-enabled a rather familiar Radio 4 personality.</blockquote><blockquote>Hello, I'm Charlotte Green and I work for BBC Radio 4 and I'm a newsreader. I'm also a robot!</blockquote><blockquote>Well I'm glad you mentioned the fact that you're a robot Charlotte, let me introduce you to CharBot Green [yes!], your robotic equivalent! What do you think of it?</blockquote><blockquote>Well I rather like the fact that I've got an antenna growing out of the top of my head, maybe I should adopt that look. I think it's fun, and it's fun to be called CharBot as well!</blockquote><blockquote>Well, shall we give it a go? Shall we see how CharBotGreen speech compares with yourself. I'm going to give you one of her robotic announcements to read, maybe the <a href="http://twitter.com/CharBotGreen/statuses/1312644966">last one, there</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>The last one? Right. Starting now on Radio 4: Chi-Chi: Panda Ambassador hash p i d colon b double-oh j oh p p 6</blockquote><blockquote>It was all going very well until the end</blockquote><blockquote>[both Charlotte and Chris giggle]</blockquote></p><p>The programme is only available on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hz1v1">iPlayer</a> for another six days, so I've saved a one-minute <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2009/01/CharBotGreen/PM-13032009-CharBotGreen.mp3">clip of the conversation</a> along with the <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2009/01/CharBotGreen/">Creative Commons licensed artwork</a>.
