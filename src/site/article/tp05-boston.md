<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/138864/'>TP05 Boston</a> is a set of 210 odd photographs I took during the <a href=''>W3C 2005 Technical Plenary</a> week in Boston. There are also tons of great photos on Flickr tagged with <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/techplen/'>techplen</a>. Finally, I've set up a shared <a href='http://www.flickr.com/groups/85569625@N00/'>pool</a> for favourite photos of the event.
