<a href='http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/05/VoxPopuli'>Tim Bray</a> points at <a href='http://www.radiovoxpopuli.org/'>Radio Vox Populi</a>. This site aggregates blogs and presents them as an audio stream. It's  worth a visit and although it's not exactly Radio 4 it does reward listening for more than a just a couple of minutes.
