<p>Great article from <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/">Werner Vogels</a> on the Amazon Technology Platform, my favorite quote being:</p>
<blockquote>Do we see that customers who develop applications using AWS care about REST or SOAP? Absolutely not! A small group of REST evangelists continue to use the Amazon Web Services numbers to drive that distinction, but we find that developers really just want to build their applications using the easiest toolkit they can find. They are not interested in what goes on the wire or how request URLs get constructed; they just want to build their applications.</blockquote>
<p>Yup, developers just want to write code to buy that book, not buy into an ethos.</p>
