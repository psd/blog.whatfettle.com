<p>Well it took me long enough to upload this little lot. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/72057594094661762/">USA, April 2006</a> is a set of 435 odd photos taken during the best part of three weeks travelling on the left side of the pond with the mrs and wor bairns, imposing on good friends along the way. So thanks to Marc, Alison, Caleb, Alex, Polly, Katja, David, Nicholas, Christopher, Chris, Sarah, Sam, Charlie, Lara, Jonathan, Deanna, Gen, Laine, Mojo, Tony, Lotus et al for putting us up, and putting up with us - it was an adventure we won't forget in a long, long time!</p>
