It's British to the core, and captures what it was like to for someone of my generation to attend a state school from my part of the world. An excellent cast and universal themes explain why it's now <a href="http://www.historyboysonbroadway.com/">on Broadway</a> and in advanced production as a <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0464049/">feature film</a>.</p><p>Dear geeks, may I humbly suggest you take any chance to see this because not only does this explain why your 40+ year old hairy-arsed northern-blogger is how he is*, it also provides a warning for those of us who advocate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development">Test Driven Development.</a>. 
</p><p>[minor spoiler:] The story surrounds a group of VI formers and the school's ambition that as many of them should go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a>, something no pupil from the school had achieved previously. Rather than providing them with an all-round education, the students are trained to pass the entrance exam itself. The results aren't exactly as intended, :</p><blockquote>Irwin: What happened at Oxford?<br>
Man: Cambridge. It didn't work out.<br>
Irwin: I think I heard that.<br>
Man: All the effort went into getting there and then I had nothing left. I thought I got somewhere, but then I found I had to go on.
