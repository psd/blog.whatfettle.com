Tuesday night, and off to the newly refurbished <a href='http://www.therexcinema.com'>Rex</a> in trendy Berkhamsted.

Closed in 1988 it was split into a bingo hall and a parade of shops before laying derelict for the best part of 20 years. The recent redevelopment was funded in part by splitting the original building into three parts: some <a href='http://www.nkhomes.com/developments_therex.htm'>expensive flats</a>; a foyer which has been leased to a chain restaurant with some tables outside in the summer:

and the cinema itself, which now has a much smaller entrance at the side of the building;

Sadly 'The Rex' neon sign seems to be broken already:

Once you get past the incomplete entrance you're instantly transported back into thirties splendour:

The black walls are adorned with art deco shell lights:

There's a magnificent gold plastered ceiling:

but top billing has to go to the stage:

with its fantastic <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscenium_arch'>proscenium arch</a>:

The circle has traditional theatre seating. Downstairs is open plan with cocktail tables:

and a reasonably priced bar:

so you can enjoy a drink at your table and then swivel round to watch the film once it starts:

As for the film programme, so far it looks like a pretty good mix. Wish they'd get their act together with the web site. (<i>Update: <a href='http://www.therexcinema.com'>they</a> have!</i>) We saw <a href='http://imdb.com/title/tt0318462/combined'>The Motorcycle Dairies</a> which was sold out:.

This was the second time I've seen this naturalistic gem which is without doubt now one of my favourite films of all time - see my <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/imdb.html'>Imdb voting history</a>.

Fingers crossed it manages to pay it's way - it's great fun having such a fantastic place less than 10 minutes walk down the road!
