A while back <a href='http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/mgudgin/'>Gudge</a> blogged how quantum computing would kill RSA by <a href='http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/mgudgin/#nn2003-12-02T10:22:42Z'>finding prime factors</a> and I suggested that by then we'd probably have <a href='http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/mgudgin/#nn2003-12-03T04:05:57Z'>quantum cryptography</a>. Well, the BBC has just reported how <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3543495.stm'>quantum codes debut in real world</a> including links to vendors selling quantum random number generators, key exchange and VPN equipment you can apparently buy today. I've doubled checked and it's not April the 1st!
