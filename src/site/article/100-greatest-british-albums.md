The <a href='http://www.observermusicmonthly.co.uk/'>Observer Music Monthly Magazine</a> (free with the Sunday Observer) had one of those lists I love to hate: <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1244183,00.html'>100 Greatest British Albums</a>.

OK, what are they on? The "Stone Roses" were great, but ultimately a tribute band to the Rolling Stones in the way Oasis are bootleg Beatles. 

And what, no Cure,  Genesis, One Giant Leap, Nitin Sawhney, Chemical Brothers, Leftfield, Julian Cope, XTC, Deep Purple or Siouxsie and the Banshees? If the criteria we're looking for is influence rather than delivery what about Cabaret Voltaire,  <a href='http://www.wireviews.com/'>Wire</a> or even early Ultravox - "Systems of Romance" FFS!

So off the top of my head, here's my attempt at the top 10:

1) Revolver - The Beatles
2) Blue Lines - Massive Attack 
3) Strangeways Here We Come - The Smiths
4) Solid Air - John Martyn 
5) Technique - New Order
6) Moondance - Van Morrison
7) Dark Side Of The Moon - Pink Floyd
8) Dream of the Blue Turtles - Sting
9) OK Computer - Radiohead
10) New Boots And Panties - Ian Dury And The Blockheads

Hmm.. this is hard!
