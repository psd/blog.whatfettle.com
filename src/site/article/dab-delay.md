We're best pleased with our <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalradio/'>DAB</a> radio - digital reception is fantastically clear, and you can get the new BBC stations including <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbc7/'>BBC7</a>. But, and it is a big but, if you  listen to more than one radio at the same time in another part of the house, then you need more than one of these expensive sets. This is because there is a significant delay on digital compared to the same station on VHF. Just to make things worse, if you put the same station on <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/digital/'>digital TV</a> then there is a different delay. Which begs the question which no one seems able to answer: is it just a delay in the digital transmission, or can I expect yet another different delay if I buy a different make or model of DAB radio ?
