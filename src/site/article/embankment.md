<p>Sunday, and a family jaunt out to see Rachel Whiteread's installation at the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/whiteread/default.shtm">Tate Modern</a>. Entitled "EMBANKMENT" it's either 1,400 or 14,000 (the curator didn't seem to know) white boxes stacked at one end of the turbine hall. Verdict: an interesting idea on paper, and the kid's loved it, but ultimately as empty as the boxes themselves. Maybe that was the point!</p>
