<p>Another year, and another quiz sheet for our local school Spring Fair. Rather poignantly, this is probably our last one given our youngest leaves the school this term. The theme of this year's fair is "Make do and Mend", so in <a href="http://whatfettle.com/Quiz">this quiz</a> each picture represents a WWII poster. And of course I had to include <a href="http://philwhitehouse.blogspot.com/2009/03/mrs-sew.html">Mrs Sew and Sew</a>. As usual, I'll post the answers after the prize draw.</p>
