<p>I trust the water piped directly to my house, but I'm more careful when it comes to packages which flop through my letterbox. A signed-sealed envelope delivered by a courier boosts my confidence, but helps a lot more if I know who sent it. So whilst WS-Security offers a little more than just TLS, it's the thought and effort being expended to establish and exchange <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2006/10/01/one-step-forward/">identity</a> that currently gives WS-* the security edge over REST. It's great to see that RESTians are starting to at least see the issue, triggered by <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/12/01/restful-security/">Pete Lacy</a> and <a href="http://1raindrop.typepad.com/1_raindrop/2006/12/rest_security_o.html">Gunnar Peterson's</a> great posts. But don't panic: I suspect the establishment of  Trust and exchange of Identities may indeed be answered by SOAP/WSS, only it'll be baked-hard and packaged into something like <a href="http://cardspace.netfx3.com/">CardSpace</a>. That way the slippy stuff won't prevent us from continuing to use the Web and <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/11/29/they-cant-hear-you/">getting shit done</a>.</p>
