<a href='http://www.allofmp3.com'>allofmp3.com</a> is tempting, and apparently legitimate, within Russian copyright laws that is. Anyway it's a lesson to <a href='http://www.apple.com/itunes/'>itunes</a> on how to run a music service: lots of music, lots of options on quality and format, and a charging model based upon data downloaded, not per-song. Oh, and it's $0.01 per megabyte, so you can download ~15 CD quality tracks for the price of one lossy compressed itune. Now all I need to do is pluck up the courage to enter my credit card number into a Russian web site ..
