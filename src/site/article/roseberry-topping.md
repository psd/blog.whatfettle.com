Roseberry Topping is an interesting shaped hill close to where I was brought-up in North Yorkshire. I passed it on the way back to Saltburn last weekend and couldn't resist taking a couple of snaps.

<a href='http://mercury.ccil.org/~cowan/'>John Cowan</a> sent me a interesting  background on the name in a discussion on Yorkshireisms some time ago:

<blockquote>
Another data point is provided by the name of Roseberry Topping, whose original name was "Oðinsbeorg" (Oðin's Mountain), probably deliberately distorted to "Rosesbeorg" when the Norse were christianized.  It's the only placename in England which refers to a pagan god.  Of course, Oðin in his natively English form of Woden has left his mark on Wodenes dag = Wednesday.
</blockquote>

As confirmed by the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseberry_Topping/'>Wikipedia entry</a>.
