Those of us brought up in the 60s, who fully expected to be traveling to work by nuclear powered Jet Pack from our free fusion electrically supplied homes by now, but instead are faced with wonders of the 21st century such as non-drip paint, the jug kettle and SPAM email, may be forgiven for being a little skeptical of BT's new <a href="http://www.btplc.co.uk/Innovation/News/timeline/index.htm">innovation timeline</a>. Apparently we'll <a href="http://www.btplc.co.uk/Innovation/News/edition.htm">probably</a> have "virtual windows" by 2007 (Vista anynbody?), invented time travel by 2035, moved into cyberspace by 2038 (have they not heard of <a href="http://www.2038bug.com/">the year 2038 bug</a>?) travelled faster than light by 2045 and met ET by 2050. Aye, champion!
