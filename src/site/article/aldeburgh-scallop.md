The contraversal Scallop on Aldebugh beach is interesteing. I'm not sure what to make of it. <a href=''>Maggi Hambling</a> sees it a tribute to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Britten'>Benjamin Britten</a>.

Though this is where the controvesy starts - Britten was inspired by the emptyness of the beach. Sticking a 5 metre high lump of stainless in the middle does change the view somewhat!

Ultimately, like any work of art, I think it deserves to be judged solely on it's asthetics and it's on that level which I'm undecided. I just can't decide if I like the look of the thing!
