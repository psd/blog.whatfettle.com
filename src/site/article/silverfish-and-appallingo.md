<p>It's funny how <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/05/02/silly-season">many people are trying to reinvent</a> (own) the Web, with "rich clients" (rich vendors) and yet all of them miss the point by a mile. The Web is already great big repository of data. Burring that data inside propriety blobs of eye candy isn't any kind of progress. Let's continue to keep the <a href="http://dubinko.info/blog/2007/04/30/why-does-rich-client-equal-bad-separation-of-presentation-from-content/">style separate from the content</a>, eh?</p>
