I've been enjoying Hugh McLeod's <a href='http://gapingvoid.com'>gapingvoid.com</a> blog which he illustrates with his own  cartoons (warning - anglo-saxon language), but his "how to be creative" (<a href='http://www.changethis.com/6.HowToBeCreative'>PDF</a>) is quite inspirational, in a down-to-earth way. Oh, and  incase you're wondering where I fit in the above diagram: "<a href='http://www.beck.com/diskobox/song.php?id=00162'>soy un perdedor</a>" :)
