I feel rather bitter sweet about this - yesterday Pete handed me a copy of <a href='http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/Overview.html'>Weaving the Web</a> which he picked up at his local library for Â£1.

On the one hand - great! I now have a hard-backed copy of this excellent book. On the other hand I'm saddened by a public library discarding this whilst keeping copies of "Programming Borland C++ for Dummies" on its shelves. 

It also puts paid to any ideas I might have had about 'dining out' on how I'm working in the great Sir Tim Berners Lee's 'WWW' organisation :-(
