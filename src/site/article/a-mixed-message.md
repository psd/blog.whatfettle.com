The XML world is split into two camps: those who see it as a document  format for <em>encapsulating</em> data and those who view it as just another <em>serialisation</em>. The litmus test for which camp you fall into being would an XML Schema for your XML documents contain 'mixed' attributes?  So as someone tasked with bridging this divide in my day job but firmly 'headed' in the mixed camp, I'm really enjoying all the buzz surrounding the notion of <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats">micro formats</a>. I really wish I was in Amsterdam this week,  in part to follow the <a href="http://www.xtech-conference.org/2005/tracks.asp#opendata">open data</a> track, but especially to hear <a href="http://people.w3.org/~dom/">Dom</a> talking about <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/grddl/">GRDDL</a>. That is all.
