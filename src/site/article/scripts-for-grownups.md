In the week that IBM'ers rejoiced over the announcement of official support for their using Firefox and the amazing <a href='http://diveintomark.org/'>Mark Pilgrim</a> published his latest free book <a href='http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/'>Dive into Greasemonkey</a>, I was passed an industry analyst report, you know the sort that big companies pay big money for their <i>insight</i>, which, says something along the lines: "Greasemonkey has absolutely no place on corporate  computers [snip] it opens you up to exploits, performance problems, and support chaos.". I found this really depressing. Firstly as any good cook knows you're more likely to cut yourself using blunt knives. Secondly, I wonder what really is the difference between a GM script and a bookmarklet such as <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/flickreplacr.html">flickreplacr</a>. Guess <a href='http://www.mnot.net/'>mnot</a> maybe onto something with his ideas for a <a href='http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/05/09/greasemonkey'>Greasemonkey proxy</a> if it puts corporate thought-police minds at rest, but in essence GM is about personal computing and that is always going to be in contention with those responsible for protecting the herd - "you do realise it's not your computer, it's the company's".</p>
