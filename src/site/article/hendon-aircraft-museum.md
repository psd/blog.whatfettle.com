Last Sunday we enjoyed a family outing to <a href='http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/hendon/'>Hendon Aircraft Museum</a>.

The museum has a new exhibit hall funded by money from the <a href='http://www.national-lottery.co.uk'>National Lottery</a>:

Nice new entrance hall, with trendy wall of decals and a Spitfire mascot:

The new hall reminded me of my teenage bedroom ceiling covered in hanging <a href='http://www.airfix.com'>Airfix</a> models, only here it's the real thing:

A walk inside the Sunderland flying boat made <a href='http://www.easyjet.com'>easyJet</a> seem like luxury :-)

Say cheese:

There are lots of fun hands-on exhibits, including this hot-air balloon:

A remote controlled Cessna in a wind tunnel:

This was our favourite, a parcel drop simulator.  First a package is loaded into a model plane using a lift.  Then the plane flies across the ceiling, the parcel released under control of bomb-aimer Jed:

A nice day out, even for a peace-nick like me!
