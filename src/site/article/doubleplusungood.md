As of tomorrow US immigration will <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3699276.stm'>fingerprint and photograph all UK visitors</a>.  So this is how Bush rewards countries who are 'with him'. I somehow doubt this action would have prevented 9/11 or helped in the subsequent investigation, but I am sure it's going to upset a lot of otherwise moderate people.
