The latest random dictionary filled SPAMs bounced by <a href='http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/'>SpamBayes</a> (ha!) are very Haiku like:

<blockquote>abovementioned catfish deceitful gothic platoon subjectivity slogging lola burma climate defray propeller eight levin patentee malton tanzania markov</blockquote>

This inspired me to write my own spamku:

<blockquote>Hi friend, click here now!
<br />Male enlargement, buy Viagra?
<br />Filter Bayesian.</blockquote>
