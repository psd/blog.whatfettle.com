There is a TV advert in the UK at the moment for Tunes, the sweets that "help you breathe more easily". Set in a deathly-dull meeting, the words "XML" and "infoset" are clearly audible. I'd like to have witnessed the "brainstorm" where creatives decided on Web technologies as the most boring subject they could think of :-)  Needless to say  <a href='http://www.mars.com/Trademarks.asp'>Mars</a> have one of the crapiest Web sites going with next to zero information on this venerable product, so I guess the last laugh is on them!
