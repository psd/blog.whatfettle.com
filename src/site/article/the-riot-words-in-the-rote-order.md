<p>Of late, I've been enjoying the effect on my addled sensorium from re-rediscovering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medium_is_the_Massage">The Medium is the Massage</a>. Inspired by <a href="http://openlibrary.org/b/OL450147M/medium_is_the_massage">this wonderful book</a> and how The Web means we now all <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2007/08/i-happen-to-have-mr-mcluhan-right-here.html">happen to have Mr McLuhan right here</a> led to massaging a bunch of <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/subjects/television/">quotations about television</a>:</p>

<p>This post was brought to you by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-q-element">q</a> element combined with a currently invalid use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-cite-element">cite</a> element. It definitely does not use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-b-element">b</a> element to designate a person because let's face it, that would be nuts. I'm unlikely to <a href="http://24ways.org/2009/incite-a-riot">incite a riot</a>, but do think the HTML 5 spec should be massaged if it wants to reflect HTML as she is wrote; <q>the <i>riot</i> words in the rote order</q> &mdash; <cite>James Joyce</cite>.</p>
