I've been a fan of John Peel most of my adult life - first as a teenager staying up late to listen to his Radio 1 programme, and then to <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hometruths/'>Home Truths</a>. So like many brits today's <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3955289.stm'>sad news</a> has knocked me for six :-(
