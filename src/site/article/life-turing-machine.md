<a href='http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5304'>Robert Kay</a> blogs about an inspiring talk given by <a href='http://www.perl.com/pub/au/Conway_Damian'>Damian Conway</a> in which he brought together Conway's (no relation) <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life'>Game of Life</a>,  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon'>Maxwell's Demon</a> along side the Klingon and Perl languages! He references Paul Rendell's <a href='http://rendell.server.org.uk/gol/tm.htm'>Life Turing Machine</a> which was new to me and is simply amazing. There are some cracking demos of various components on the <a href='http://rendell.server.org.uk/gol/tmdetails.htm'>details page</a>, one of my favourites being the <a href='http://rendell.server.org.uk/gol/pictures/inout.htm'>Finite State Machine</a> from which the above snapshot was taken.
