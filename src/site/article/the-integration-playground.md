<p>It does indeed seem that vendors have spent the last 8 years pushing an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto">Esperanto</a> for integration in the shape of Web Services. Well actually they've built a series of weak agreements on how to mint, describe and exchange <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language">auxiliary languages</a>, encourage customers to <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/04/data_integration.html">build their own vocabularies</a>, then disenfranchise them when they happen to use something from a competitor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the cool Web 2.0 kids have been playing and rolled out "good enough" patterns of use and <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/delicious.html">pigin languages</a> for integration on the Web in the shape of RSS/Atom and HTML/Microformats. OK, they don't have much of a story for <a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=637">authentication</a>, yet, but it's only a matter of time before all this <a href="http://tpi.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page">Tok Pisin</a> evolves into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language">creole</a>, proves white is black and the current computing establishment disappears in a puff of logic. </p>
<p>And if all that wasn't enough to scare the incumbent wisdom, up in the sixth form there's a bunch of cool science projects demonstrating how to put all your data into <a href="http://ancientgeeks.wordpress.com/2007/04/21/paul-downey-on-web-apis/">a single unified form</a>. I'm enormously attracted to RDF, not least because I want to embed data flatly into a feed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoRSS">geoRSS</a> style. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_World_Assumption">Open content</a> is definitely the way to go for versioning. I also love the notion of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/scalable_rdbms_mapping_report/">triple stores</a>. However after trying and failing to get <a href="http://triplr.org">triplr</a> to work beyond the trivial, I returned to scraping HTML with <a href="http://www.dapper.net">dapper</a> and regex'ing the text with <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Pipes</a>. Show me some useful, fun, active, live triples out there in the wild, beyond <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification">RSS 2.0</a> and <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> and I'll buy 'em!</p>
