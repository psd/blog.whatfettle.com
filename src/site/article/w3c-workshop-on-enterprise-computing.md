<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/01/wos-ec-program.html">programme</a> is out for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/10/wos-ec-cfp.html">W3C Workshop on Web of Services for Enterprise Computing</a>. Seems I'm first up in a morning of Web love from <span class="vcard"><a href="http://www.markbaker.ca" class="fn url" rel="friend met colleague">Mark Baker</a></span>, <span class="vcard"><a href="http://www.mnot.net" class="fn url" rel="friend met colleague co-worker">Mark Nottingham</a></span> and <span class="vcard"><a href="http://larve.net/people/hugo/" class="fn url" rel="friend met colleague co-worker">Hugo Haas</a></span>. Guess overlap is why <span class="vcard"><a href="http://ironick.typepad.com/" rel="friend met colleague" class="fn url">Nick Gall</a> of <span class="org">Gartner</span></span> isn't up to present, but make sure you read <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/01/wos-papers/gall">his paper</a>. It's a stormer!
</p>
<p>To quote from <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/01/wos-papers/bt">my own</a>, pretty robust, paper:</p>
<blockquote>many of these scenarios span multiple organisations, which themselves can be quite fluid or virtual; capabilities may be bought in, outsourced or exposed as a product at very short notice to meet a business opportunity. In certain cases BT is required to expose services used internally in an equivalent form to competitors as a result of regulation. For BT, the term "enterprise computing" does not imply "within a single organisation".</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Web is the answer to all your problems, now what is this "enterprise" thing of which you speak?</p>
