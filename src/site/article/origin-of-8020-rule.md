I've just had a quick look for the origin of the 80/20 rule - an expression used <i>ad-nausia</i> in standards when asserting what is the most common use-case. 

This is often attributed as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle'>The Pareto Principle</a>  named after Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist who studied the distribution of wealth in a variety of countries.  His law of the vital few and the principle of factor sparsity states that for many phenomena 80% of consequences stem from 20% of the causes.

However, several other sources describe how <a href='http://www.juran.com/lower_2.cfm?article_id=21'>Joseph Juran</a>, the quality management guru, formalised a universal principle he called the "vital few and trivial many" and first coined the term "80/20".

Looking on Google, the split between <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=Pareto+%2B80+%2B20'>Pareto</a>/<a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=Juran+%2B80+%2B20'>Juran</a> is roughly 80/20   :^)
