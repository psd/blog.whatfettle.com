Dasani has just been launched here in the UK and depressingly the Football League has taken £15m bung from Coca-Cola to promote its products including this awful tasting stuff.  Maybe this signals a return to "sexy football" as the word "Dasani" is apparently ancient Sanskrit for a young woman whose job was to "deliver pleasure" to kings. 

As mentioned <a href='http://blog.whatfettle.com/archives/000009.html'>earlier</a>, it tastes awful and I strongly advocate that you DO NOT BUY this stuff! If you are offered this by a company at a meeting in lieu of a nice drink, ask them how paying for filtered, salted, bottled tap water sold at a 3000% markup improves share-holder value.
