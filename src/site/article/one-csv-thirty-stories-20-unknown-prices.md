	<p><em>This is day 20 of <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/10/13/one-csv-thirty-stories/">One <span class="caps">CSV</span>, 30 stories</a> a series of articles exploring <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads">price paid data</a> from the Land Registry found on <span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK. The code for this and the other articles is available as open source from <a href="https://github.com/psd/price-paid-data">GitHub</a></em></p>

	<p><a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/11/25/one-csv-thirty-stories-19-bubblepleth/">Yesterday</a> was hard work for no avail, so today for a quick-win I&#8217;ve fallen back on something reasonably obvious, <a href="http://psd.github.io/price-paid-data/html/unknown-prices.html">using d3 to plot</a> the average price-per-postcode to form a well-known album cover:</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/15884902641" title="Unknown Prices by Paul Downey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7470/15884902641_21b1fdc32c_c.jpg" width="800" height="575" alt="Unknown Prices"></a></p>

	<p>Er, why trot out that old trope, you might ask. Well I was 16 when Joy Division released <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures">Unknown Pleasures</a> and it spoke to me, not least because of Peter Saville&#8217;s iconic album cover which had no text, but what appeared to be an intriguing, futuristic, computer rendered landscape.  I particularly remember trying to recreate the image using 6502 machine code on my friend&#8217;s dad&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-65">Rockwell <span class="caps">AIM</span> 65</a> the only computer I&#8217;d seen at that point with any kind of output beyond a seven-segment display. The results on ephemeral, thermal printer paper are sadly long-gone. </p>

	<p>I also remember being thrilled to see the same image appear later the same year, as the lander descended in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28film%29">Alien</a>:</p>

	<p>Growing up in the north-east of England, we were very aware of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott">Ridley Scott&#8217;s</a> local heritage (he&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_hanger">monkey hanger</a>), and since then I&#8217;ve felt a similar, strange bond with other people who have found ways of paying homage to this image which includes a number of people I know including <a href="http://revdancatt.com/">Dan Catt</a> whose <a href="http://revdancatt.com/2013/03/06/project-cat820-joy-divisualization">Project CAT820</a> uses Processing.js, a great little library which I&#8217;ve experimented with myself, and <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/05/11/tiddlyprocessing/">written about here, before</a>. I have also lost far too much time exploring <a href="http://mroctopus.net/geo/elevation-lines.html">Elevation Lines</a> but it was <a href="http://suda.co.uk/">Brian Suda</a>&#8217;s original image of Iceland which really captured my imagination:</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/suda/5384299394" title="Unknown Pleasures: Iceland by Brian Suda, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5217/5384299394_d6c52bb84f_z.jpg" width="640" height="452" alt="Unknown Pleasures: Iceland"></a></p>

	<p>The research tools available to today&#8217;s 16 year old are very different to those in 1979, nevertheless, I&#8217;m still somewhat embarrassed to admit I had little idea where this visualisation originated until Jeremy wrote about the data behind the design of <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/1489"><span class="caps">FACT</span> 10</a> and the way <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6531">Jocelyn Bell Burnell&#8217;s</a> ground-breaking pulsar discovery was explained using the original visualisation published in the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. I&#8217;ve written before about how <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/10/24/on-the-vanity-of-demanding-attribution/">I&#8217;m not bothered about attribution</a> and ultimately I&#8217;m very down with remix culture, of which this is a great, early digitalish example, but I&#8217;m less sanguine about the how the work of great women like Jocelyn goes mundanely unacknowledged. </p>

	<p>Anyway, we hopefully, are moving towards a different age. Here&#8217;s Peter on the story behind the cover, and the impact of his design:</p>

	<p>So it might be a lazy trope, and it&#8217;s definitely very late for me to jump on the bandwagon, but I still find it an aesthetically pleasing image, and it speaks directly to my inner teenager. <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/12/02/mistakes-were-made/">Tomorrow</a> I&#8217;ll start to dig into addresses.</p>
