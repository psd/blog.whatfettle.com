According to <a href='http://www.presidentmatch.com/'>President Match</a> my views align with:

1  Kucinich 100%
2  Sharpton 100%
3  Kerry 90%
4  Clark 86%
5  Dean 85%
6  Edwards 78%
7  Bush 16%

1/6th in agreement with Bush! I feel unclean! Of course this might a lot more sense if I was American and eligible to vote.
