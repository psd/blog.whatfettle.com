<p>As much as I love the new <a href="http://www.central-park-studio.com/">Central Park Studio</a> site, it doesn't, well I mean really cannot, do full justice to <a href="http://www.central-park-studio.com/bio.htm">Deanna's</a> artwork which has to be seen in the flesh to grasp the fine detail and ideally  bathed in the Californian light which it reflects and refracts beautifully.
