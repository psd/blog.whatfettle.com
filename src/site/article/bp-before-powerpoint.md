<p>A few years ago, OK 19, I had to present our proposed architecture for a graphics terminal emulation card. This was before the days of <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,872912,00.html">Powerpoint</a> when preparing slides involved drawing on transparent plastic with felt tipped pens.  The photocopies of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/34471410/">hand drawn slides</a> I just happened upon tickle me even now, in part because my 'font' was created by tracing the letters from a newspaper (the pre-Murdoch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times">Times</a>), but mostly because they demonstrate a shameless devotion to abstraction.</p>
<p>My current presentation tool of choice is <a href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/">slidy</a>.</p>
