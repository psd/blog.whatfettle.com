<p>It's worrying how often in exploring use-cases for Identity such as "wouldn't it be cool if after a day out with two families, we'd be able to better control of who can see the photos of each other's kids?" I'd actually be describing use-cases for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management">Digital Rights Management</a>. Yet DRM is intrinsically evil, no? Well it seems that Microsoft are still in love with it, despite <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2004/06/18/cory-doctorow-on-drm/">Cory's excellent talk</a> and the much hyped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Zune">Zune</a> player apparently will come with <a href="http://www.medialoper.com/hot-topics/microsoft/microsoft-insider-clarifies-zunes-sharing-limitations/">a new viral DRM system</a>. Time will tell if customers find this enabling or simply infuriating. I'd bet on the latter. Of course if you're French and want to copy stuff you might as well <a href="http://defectivebydesign.org/en/actions/oct3/french_citizens_confess_drm_circumvention_activities">turn yourself in now</a>.
