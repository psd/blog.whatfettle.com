Well this morning I woke up to 300+ comment SPAMs posted to this Web log. I've an idea on how to mutate the Perl to kill most of it, but moving to <a href='http://wordpress.org'>Wordpress</a> sounds attractive right now. I don't want to give in and disable comments, but that could be my final option :-(

As the great Vint Cerf said in a recent interview, there is a simple technical solution we can use to combat SPAM: <a href='http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/3370411'>Public Flogging</a>.
