<p>A few years ago I stepped into the front seat of a taxi in Madrid and put on my seat belt only to realise my defensive action had insulted the driver. It wasn't his driving ability I was worried about so much, just every other nutter on the Spanish highway. Anyway, I just had a similar feeling whilst browsing the <a href="http://www.vonage.com/features.php?feature=developers">Vonage Developer's Center</a> [sic].  So far they have a single service '<a href="https://secure.click2callu.com/">Third Party Call Control</a>'. Whilst they provide a nice simple URI to HTTP GET the address book, (it's a shame they put the password as a parameter), this is the bit that bothers me:</p>
<blockquote>The W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html#checklist">recommends</a>
using HTTP POST instead of GET for URLs like these,
however both are supported.</blockquote>
<p>So they know they're not safe and they're breaking <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#safe-interaction">Web Architecture</a> but just don't seem to want you to buckle-up.</p>
