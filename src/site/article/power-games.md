Everything in the US is bigger, heavier and more powerful than in the UK with one obvious exception: electrical power. I imagine it's having 220v in the UK as opposed to 110 volts in the US that has led to our plugs being much larger and power supplies three times heavier, as with these two Gameboy adaptors.
