<p>Thanks to a dose of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_flu">man flu</a>, I've not been sleeping well, and the other night found myself counting sheep, <i>Yan, Tan, Thethera, Mether, Pip, Azer, Sezar, Akker, Conter, Dick</i>. Where the heck had that come from? The following evening we sat down to watch a documentary about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Thackray">Jake Thackray</a> (Yorkshire's answer to <a href="http://www.georges-brassens.com">George Brassens</a>) in which he sang a Swaledale shepherd's song "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Tan_Tethera">Yan Tean Tethera</a>". Spooky!</p>
