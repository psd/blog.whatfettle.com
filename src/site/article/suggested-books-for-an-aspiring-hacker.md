<p>I've been asked by the parents of an enthusiastic 14 year old computer nut for some fun “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communication_technology">ICT</a>” reads. Resisting an urge to cry “oxymoron”, I morphed what sounded like a request to reinforce the current curriculum of government procurement writ large in today's schools into a subversive introduction to old school free software and hacker culture:</p><ol>
<li><div class="hreview"><span class="item"><a class="fn url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution">Hackers</a></span>	- <span class="summary"><a href="http://www.stevenlevy.com/">Steven Levy</a>'s nice potted history of hackerdom from the MIT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club">Tech Model Railroad Club</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club">Homebrew Computer Club</a> and the resulting Silicon Valley microcomputer game hackers. Also highly recommended is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto:_How_the_Code_Rebels_Beat_the_Government_Saving_Privacy_in_the_Digital_Age">Crypto</a> by the same author.</span>
</div>				
<li><div class="hreview"><span class="item"><a class="fn url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine">The Soul of a New Machine</a></span> - <span class="summary"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Kidder">Tracy Kidder</a>'s Pulitzer prize winning story of pressured development in the days of Minicomputers. Riveting, with some great insight into the motivations for hackers in the zone.</span>
</div>
<li><div class="hreview"><span class="item"><a class="fn url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_Book">The Code Book</a></span> - <span class="summary"><a href="http://www.simonsingh.net">Simon Singh</a>'s not strictly computing, but a very drinkable technical history from steganography exemplified by Histaiaeus shaving the heads of his messengers, writing the message on his scalp, and then waiting for the hair to re-grow, to the mind-bending world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer">quantum computing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography">quantum cryptography</a> all interspersed with some great puzzles. Totally inspiring!</span>
</div>
<li><div class="hreview"><span class="item"><a class="fn url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoos_Egg">The Cookoo's Egg</a></span> - <span class="summary"><a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~stoll/">Clifford Stoll</a>'s personal tale of how being tasked with resolving a $0.75 accounting error led him to foiling a computer cracker using Berkeley's lab to break into military systems. He grows tomatoes and microwaves his tennis shoes in the process.</span>
</div>
<li><div class="hreview"><span class="item"><a class="fn url" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BestSoftwareWriting.html">Best Software Writing</a> </span> - <span class="summary"><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>'s nice collection of snappy contemporary essays, possibly more likely to date badly than many of the above.</span>
</div>
</ol><p>Actually, I'm unhappy with the fifth choice so wondered about <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a> mainly for the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How to be a Hacker</a> essay, <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/">Fred Books</a>' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man_Month">The Mythical Man Month</a> as an entertaining glimpse into large scale computer development, chocked full of great adages such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">There is no Silver Bullet</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_and_Painters">Hackers and Painters</a> because it says, it's OK to be a geek and encourages learning LISP, and the rather dense <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/">Beautiful Code</a>, for once he's actually smitten with programming.</p>
<p>So, dear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LazyWeb">LazyWeb</a>, did I do wrong? What other gems did I miss?</p>
