<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/9939037/" title="Addressing Group setting up by psd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/8/9939037_fe5e8b4c64_z.jpg" width="240" height="101" alt="Addressing Group setting up" /></a><p>I recently attended a meeting where the Chair justifiably concerned at the <a href="http://my.opera.com/chaals/blog/show.dml/52310">enormous cost</a>, and renowned kittenish behavior of some of the attendees (er, me!), asked us all to close our notebooks to give the discussion our full, undivided attention.  Denied access <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/1371558503/">my external brain</a>, I found the experience unusually stressful, and functioned quite badly. I recall saying "um", "er" and "ooh-ooh-agh" a lot. As anyone who has attended a W3C meeting will testify, being able to chat to others, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent">take minutes and notes</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/06/tracker/">record actions</a>, ask for clarifications, paste in URI's, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot.html">who is on the phone</a>, work out who is speaking or making noise, join the speaker's queue, <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2007/chad/">conduct straw polls</a>, crack jokes and heckle all over IRC makes for a far more productive meeting. Working together over a back channel is far better than giving the one person able to speak the unbroken gaze of a room full of folded arms and weary eyeballs.
