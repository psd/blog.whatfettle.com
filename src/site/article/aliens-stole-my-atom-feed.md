<p>Something strange happened and for a while I was <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/feed/">feeding</a> you all pug-ugly RSS 2.0, but it's hopefully back to gloriously <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.whatfettle.com%2Ffeed%2F">Valid Atom 1.0</a> again, all be it with a couple of warnings from the embedded Google Video. Let's thank <a href="http://www.tapsellferrier.co.uk">Nic</a>, for pointing that out.</p>
<p><i>Update: it was worse than that, thanks to an interaction between <a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/wordpress-atom-1.0/">wp-atom10</a> and <a href="http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/">wp-cache</a> I was serving it as <code>text/html</code>. Excuse me while I go to stand in the corner of the room.</i></p>
