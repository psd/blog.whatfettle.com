Next Saturday is our kid's school Spring Fair and this year there is a medieval theme. For our sins we produce the programme, Lucy did the hard work of selling advertising space leaving me burn the midnight oil slapping it all together into a 9MB PDF file. Anyway, it's with the printers now, so all that remains for me to do is come up with a quiz sheet to sell at the fair itself.
