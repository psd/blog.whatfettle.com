I was in my mid-teens at the height of punk and along with my friends dressed up in poseur "punk" gear in the toilets before pogoing around the hall at the school disco. Actually I dimly recollect also doing "the dead fly" which involved lying on your back and waving your legs in the air, geddit? Anyway, working at home today to prepare a couple of presentations, I slapped on a copy of "Never Mind the Bollox" which my parents-in-law bought for my birthday the other month. It sounds as fresh as a daisy and it was all I could do to not pogo around the Kitchen â€¦ "problem, problem, blah, blah, problem, problem, problem" ..
