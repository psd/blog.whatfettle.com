It's funny which ideas travel and which don't. Tonight I relayed to a Frenchman and two Americans how my son was attending an 'International' event at his school dressed as a "French Onion Seller". Judging from their bemused reactions, it appears the Brit perception of the archetypal Frenchman wearing a stripy T-shirt and beret and pushing a bicycle  strung with onions hadn't reached their foreign ears. 

Googling for <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=french+onion+seller'>French onion seller</a> isn't that rewarding, but funnily enough many of the top links relate to the North East such as an episode of <a href='http://www.zetaminor.com/cult/when_boat/when_boat_s1_v2.htm'>When the Boat Comes In</a>, and this amazing archive footage of Newcastle in the 1960s: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/bb/00236_4x3_bb.ram">We Know Our Onions - French Onion Sellers in Tyneside</a> Â©<a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/misc-work/ '>NRFTA</a>). Just love that Bretonne/Geordie accent, "why aye, mon cherie", "au revoir, pet".
