For reasons which are not totally clear to me now, I went to <a href='http://www.bradford.ac.uk/'>Bradford University</a>. They say you should never go back, we'll this Saturday Jon, Trev and I returned after more than 20 years, for a weekend of memories, beer and curry.

This chippy only opened on a weekday lunchtime, so we were amazed to see it still going:

They filled in the stairs down into the Computer Centre under the J.B. Priestley library, I somehow doubt they still have the CDC Cyber with async terminals down there:

The Kismet is now "OK's" .. nice curry, but what's the world coming to when you have to ask for chapattis and a side-salad?

Great Horton Road has been revamped as the new "West End":

But the <a href='http://www.kingsdr.demon.co.uk/cinemas/newvic.htm'>Odeon</a> needs some attention, not least from Ground Force on the roof:

One of my best cinema experiences was seeing <a href='http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0083987/combined'>Gandhi</a> here with a packed, mainly Asian audience:

I ate here once when it was a thriving curry house. ISTR ordering a prawn curry and being served soup with lumps of cheese in it. Halfway through the meal the next table 'did a runner' only to be chased down the road by waiters brandishing hockey sticks! I guess it being opposite the mortuary wasn't that great for business, so RIP, Paradise!

The Shearbridge! How can a pub opposite a university halls of residence go bust?

Or the slummy Pickwicks go so far down hill?

The excellent <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/going_out/pubs_1.shtml'>Fighting Cock</a> real ale pub was still going great guns though:
