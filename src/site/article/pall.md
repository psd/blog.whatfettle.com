We live a good 5 miles from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4517962.stm">Buncefield Explosion</a> and were oblivious until we turned on the radio this morning. However, one of my flickr contacts lives a little further away was woken up in time to take some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/good_day/sets/1554600/">amazing dawn shots</a>, see also the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/buncefield-fuel-depot-explosion/pool/">Buncefield Fuel Depot Explosion Pool</a> and my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/1556999/">small set</a> of <a href="http://flyr.whatfettle.com/maps?text=&#38;tags=Buncefield&#38;user=psd&#38;folder=flyr&#38;per_page=20&#38;page=1&#38;ids=72440450,72440213,72439545,72439341,72439054,72438887,72333703">geotagged</a> photos. </p>
