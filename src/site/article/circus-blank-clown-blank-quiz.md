Another year, and another quiz sheet for the school Spring Fair. The theme of this year's event is "The Circus", so the subject of each picture has either "Circus" or "Clown" in its name, or is something closely related to the circus. I'll post the answers after the prize draw. <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/Quiz/#Circus-Clown">Enjoy!</a> <i>Update: now with answers.</i>
