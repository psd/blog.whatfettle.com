As excellent as the <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059319/combined'>IPCRESS File</a> is, it doesn't make ideal early morning viewing for the jet lagged and paranoid. "Induction of Psycho-neuroses by Conditioned Reflex with streSS", I can relate to that! Anyway, <a href='http://www.johnbarry.org.uk/'>John Barry's</a> haunting theme is now playing inside my head, as Joel says "on my psychic jukebox".
