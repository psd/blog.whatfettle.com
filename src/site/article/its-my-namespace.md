<p>It's actually quite hard to read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2006/02/namespaceState/TR/2006/WD-namespaceState-20060223/">The Disposition of Names in an XML Namespace</a> above the sound of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/03/01-Boyer-Lightning/SignaturesAndNamespaces_Boyer.html">thumping tubs</a> in the background, and I was rather worried that the balance had been struck rather too finely between evolution and intelligent design until I hit:</p> <blockquote>As a general rule, resources on the web can and do change. In the absence of an explicit statement, one cannot infer that a namespace is immutable.</blockquote><p>Huzzah! So to state the bleeding obvious, namespaces are all about ownership. They're a land-grab. I always put spuds in your weekly vegetable box, but don't send it back if I happen to slip you the odd free carrot as well.
