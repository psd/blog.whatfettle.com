Whilst explaining some of the culture and ethos behind keeping your WiFi open to Nick I noticed the domain <a href='http://www.warchalking.org'>warchalking.org</a> is now up for sale. The reasons behind the demise of this counter-culture are well explained in "<a href='http://webword.com/moving/warchalking.html'>How Warchalking Died</a>". Basically it seems to be thanks to the rise of the not for profit <a href='http://www.weca.net'>WifFi Alliance</a> sign.
