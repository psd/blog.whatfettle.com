Jer Boon is raising money for Breast Cancer Research as he cycles to every Bristol City match  bike during the current football season.

Just to give you an idea of what this involves, by December he had had already clocked up 4,000 miles on his bike only to learn that two consecutive away fixtures in Grimsby and Hartlepool were to be separated by a mid-week match back in Bristol!

I fully expect this story is made into a Hollywood movie (John Cusack to play Jer ?), so if you want to be in on the ground floor, sponsor Jer today!
