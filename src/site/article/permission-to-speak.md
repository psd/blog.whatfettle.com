<p>A torrid week in the UK around what <i>constitutes</i> free speech. It's puzzling how back in October <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4514004.stm">Maya Evans</a> was found guilty of breaching the "Serious Organised Crime and Police Act" for peacefully reading out names of soldiers killed in Iraq at the Cenotaph, whilst an only yesterday there's a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4682262.stm">protest</a> in the same manor, but quite different manner during which no arrests were made. As for Mr Blair? Well it did serve him right that the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4668266.stm">Religious Hatred Bill</a> was defeated for the want of a single vote, his, especially given it's impossible to see how it would help matters. I guess "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1359967,00.html">things can only get better.</a>"</p>
