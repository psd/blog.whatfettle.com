Willard Wigan makes sculptures that are so small you need a microscope just  to see them. His works include a ship on a grain of sand, the Statue of Liberty in the eye of a needle, a boxing match on a match head and an elephant on a pin-head. He uses slivers of diamond to carve grains of sand and has to work between the centre of each heartbeat to avoid hand tremors. Other hazards include dust and static electricity. There is a permanent exhibition of his work at The Mailbox in Birmingham.
