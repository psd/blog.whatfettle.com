<a href='http://bikebiz.co.uk'>BikeBiz</a> have a nice <a href='http://www.bikebiz.co.uk/daily-news/article.php?id=4637'>round-up</a> on the phenomena of picking <a href='http://www.kryptonitelock.com'>Kryponite</a> locks using only a <a href='http://www.bicworld.com'>Bic</a> pen. It seems that Kryptonite have been slow to react, and to be as fair as possible to them they're not alone it seems to be a generic weakness in the round key lock. Expect to see bic pens sticking out of the front of vending machines and gym lockers for the foreseeable future :-(

<a href='http://www.briefhistory.com/'>John Naughton</a> in <a href='http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1312736,00.html'>today's  observer</a> draws the parallel between Microsoft's and Kryptonite's woes, oh for 'Kryptonite Update' :-) So fingers crossed I can exchange my Kryptonite lock for free in the UK as they've just <a href='http://www.kryptonitelock.com/inetisscripts/abtinetis.exe/templateform@public?tn=urgent_update'>announced</a> in the US. Either way I'll keep you posted!
