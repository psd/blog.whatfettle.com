We came back from a week's holls yesterday only to realise it was actually our 10th wedding anniversary! What gave the game away were some nice cards and flowers from our inlaws and outlaws, including this nice bowl. My mother says she found it in a charity shop in Berkhamsted, which raises a few possibilities:

<ul>
<li>we were given it as a wedding present and offloaded it .. nope!</li>
<li>there is another Lucy &amp; Paul somewhere out there and they offloaded it .. maybe.</li>
<li>the parallel L&amp;P got divorced and it was one of the few items Lucy didn't hurl across the kitchen at Paul .. quite likely!</a> 
<li>My mother actually commissioned it from a cheesy advert in the back of <a href='http://www.telegraph.co.uk'>Torygraph</a> Saturday magazine but is too embarrassed to admit to it â€¦ I think we have a winner!</li>
</ul>

Anyway, the real Lucy has just filled it with brazil nuts .. yum!
