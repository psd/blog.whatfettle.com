<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/sets/1029778'>Palo Alto</a> is a set of snaps taken during last week's W3C <a href='http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/addr/'>Web Services Addressing</a> and <a href='http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc/'>Web Services Description</a> face-to-face meetings hosted by <a href='http://www.sap.com'>TIBCO</a> in the Bay Area. It is my full intention to <a href="http://flyr.whatfettle.com">geotag</a> this little lot!</p>
