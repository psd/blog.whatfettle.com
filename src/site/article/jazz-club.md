Off to the <a href='http://www.iridiumjazzclub.com/'>Iridium Jazz Club</a> to hear <a href='http://www.montyalexander.com/'>Monty Alexander</a>, <i>Nice!</i>  He's a Jamacian pianist who fuses Jazz favourites with a calipso or reggie feel, <i>Super!</i>. They were recording the evening for his next CD, <i>Grrreat!</i> I enjoyed this very much except for the cost for a 50 minute performance - they cram three sets into one evening, <i>Hmmm!</i> This seems to be the norm for NYC Jazz clubs, <i>Ripoff!</i>
