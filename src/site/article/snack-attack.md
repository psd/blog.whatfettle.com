On the day we learn how <a href='http://news.independent.co.uk/low_res/story.jsp?story=533430&amp;host=3&amp;dir=65'>Pret a Manger are to launch pork scratchings</a> and the Today Programme has an item on <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/misc/unhealthyfoods_20040621.shtml'>chocolate covered pork fat</a>, I became seriously addicted to <a href='http://www.olivesetal.co.uk/products/snacks/'>Habas Mujados</a> (deep fried broad beans) which Lucy bought in <a href='http://www.one4six.co.uk'>Bar 146</a>. Scrummy!
